However, many MSMEs struggle with financial management, hindering their growth and access to financing. The implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards for Micro, Small, and Medium Entities (SAK EMKM) was introduced to simplify financial reporting for MSMEs. This study explores the adoption of SAK EMKM at Mutiara Laundry, a case study MSME, to assess its effect on financial transparency, decision-making, and access to external funding. The research highlights challenges such as limited financial literacy and reliance on informal accounting methods. The findings suggest that implementing SAK EMKM enhances financial management and facilitates financing opportunities. The study recommends improving financial literacy and utilizing digital tools to support MSMEs. This research contributes to the understanding of how SAK EMKM can aid MSMEs in improving financial management and long-term sustainability. Practical Implications: The findings of this study highlight that implementing financial statements based on SAK EMKM can significantly enhance the financial management capabilities of micro and small enterprises, such as Mutiara Laundry UMKM. Proper adoption enables business owners to maintain accurate and standardized records, making it easier to monitor performance, control costs, and plan for growth. It also enhances credibility with financial institutions, increasing opportunities for obtaining loans or investments. Social Implications: The adoption of SAK EMKM in micro and small enterprises like Mutiara Laundry UMKM fosters broader social benefits beyond individual business performance. Standardized and transparent financial reporting fosters trust among MSMEs, customers, suppliers, and financial institutions, thereby contributing to the development of stronger local economic ecosystems. Improved financial literacy among small business owners empowers them to make better decisions, sustain their operations, and create more stable employment opportunities in the community. Originality/Value: This study offers a practical contribution by examining the implementation of financial statements based on SAK EMKM in a real-world microenterprise context, using Mutiara Laundry UMKM as a case study. While SAK EMKM is intended to simplify financial reporting for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, empirical research on its adoption in specific service-sector businesses remains scarce. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial management; financing; MSMEs; SAK EMKM; transparency","","","","","Susanto, Sugeng, Measuring The Influence of The Central Business District Development of SDGs on The Growth and Income of People Affected by The Development of The New Nusantara Capital City, International Journal of Accounting and Economics Studies, 12, 4, pp. 447-454, (2025); Aldehayyat, Jehad S., The use of strategic planning tools and techniques by hotels in Jordan, Management Research Review, 34, 4, pp. 477-490, (2011); Ardiansyah, Misnen, ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF POSITIVE ACCOUNTING THEORY: A STUDY OF ISLAMIC BANKING IN INDONESIA, Asian Economic and Financial Review, 12, 6, pp. 380-396, (2022); Iqtishoduna Jurnal Ekonomi Islam, (2023); International Research Journal of Management IT and Social Sciences, (2019); Harun, Harun, Indonesian public sector accounting reforms: Dialogic aspirations a step too far?, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 28, 5, pp. 706-738, (2015); Conference Proceedings, (2017); Dinasti International Journal of Economics Finance Accounting Dijefa, (2024); Hoang, Thinh Gia, Business intelligence and analytic (BIA) stage-of-practice in micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 36, 4, pp. 1080-1104, (2023); Journal, (2025)","","Malque Publishing","","","","","","26751240","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016691319"

This adoption plays a vital role in advancing specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), by fostering financial inclusion, enhancing digital financial literacy, and enabling equitable access to Fintech education through smartphones. Qualitative data was collected via an online survey distributed through social media platforms and emails, allowing for a broad and inclusive reach. The questionnaire targeted the overall public, or mobile phone users in Jordan, with no age restriction, to achieve diverse opinions regarding mobile-based financial literacy and Fintech adoption. One hundred eighty-nine valid responses were obtained, forming the basis for statistical analysis. The study explores the direct correlations between educational initiatives facilitated by smartphones and the subsequent adoption of Fintech services, considering the moderating effects of digital literacy and the regulatory environment. The results show that increased digital literacy enhances the effectiveness of Fintech applications, thus promoting financial inclusivity and literacy. The structural model explains 75.4% of the variance in smartphone usage for financial education (R2 = 0.754). Hypothesis testing confirms significant positive effects, with Fintech adoption (β = 0.033, p < 0.001), educational outreach (β = 0.040, p < 0.001), and innovation in educational Fintech products (β = 0.043, p < 0.001) associated with increased smartphone usage in education. The study highlights the need for advancements in user-friendly and accessible financial services, underlining the critical role of regulatory frameworks and digital literacy in fostering a secure and inclusive financial ecosystem. These findings are consistent with and support the SDGs, providing individuals with information and tools to maintain long-term financial stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; Digital literacy; Fintech services; Innovation; Smartphone usage in education; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Sustainable EDUCATION","economic development; education; innovation; regulatory framework; Sustainable Development Goal; technology adoption; Jordan","","","","Parente, Ronaldo Couto, The Sharing Economy Globalization Phenomenon: A Research Agenda, Journal of International Management, 24, 1, pp. 52-64, (2018); Stakeholder Capitalism A Global Economy that Works for Progress People and Planet, (2021); Javaid, Mohd, Understanding the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in improving environmental sustainability, Sustainable Operations and Computers, 3, pp. 203-217, (2022); Stanford Journal of Law Business Finance, (2018); Lal Dey, Bidit Lal, Technology upgrading through co-creation of value in developing societies: Analysis of the mobile telephone industry in Bangladesh, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 145, pp. 413-425, (2019); Brill Research Perspectives in International Banking and Securities Law, (2023); Budgets and Financial Management in Higher Education, (2018); A Survey on Smartphones Security Software Vulnerabilities Malware and Attacks, (2020); Srivastava, Saurabh Ranjan, SMARTPHONE TRIGGERED SECURITY CHALLENGES - ISSUES, CASE STUDIES AND PREVENTION, pp. 187-206, (2024); Gomber, Peter, On the Fintech Revolution: Interpreting the Forces of Innovation, Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services, Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, 1, pp. 220-265, (2018)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629984","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007463075"

In fact, Islamic finance has a variety of advantages compared to conventional, and has a variety of instruments that can be developed. One of the innovations in the development of Islamic financial instruments is the combination of sukuk and waqf or called sukuk linked waqf. The development of waqf-linked sukuk is one of the innovations and a manifestation of the importance of formulating objectives derived from religious and divine values or known as the Tawhidi String Relation (TSR). The TSR approach emphasizes the truth that comes from God, while at the same time emphasizing the importance of trying to achieve the benefit of the world. The principle of TSR is the oneness of Allah SWT which is known as Tawhid which acts as the main method for the development of Islamic finance. The oneness of Allah SWT is represented in the Al-Qur’an which is then juxtaposed with As-Sunnah. Based on the TSR approach, this paper suggests that there are many arguments or basic arguments for the importance of returning the financial sector back to the sharia economy which originates from the Al-Qur’an and As-Sunnah. This weak correlation causes the innovation results in the ecosystem for the development of waqf-linked sukuk to be weak. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Islamic financial conclusion which must truly base its ecosystem on the basis of the Al-Qur’an and As-Sunnah as the foundation for the development of sukuk linked waqf. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entrepreneurial Growth; Islamic Finance; Sharia Economy; Tawhidi String Relationship; Waqf Linked Sukuk","","","","","Tifbr Tazkia Islamic Finance and Business Review, (2023); Jebis Jurnal Ekonomi Dan Bisnis Islam, (2021); Indonesian Journal of Business Accounting and Management, (2021); Ascarya, Ascarya, Proposed model of integrated Islamic commercial and social finance for Islamic bank in Indonesia, Eurasian Economic Review, 12, 1, pp. 115-138, (2022); Al-Hawary, Sulieman Ibraheem Shelash, Multiobjective optimization of a hybrid electricity generation system based on waste energy of internal combustion engine and solar system for sustainable environment, Chemosphere, 336, (2023); Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Studies, (2022); Lestari, Sri, Impact of Self-Efficacy and Work Discipline on Employee Performance in Sociopreneur Initiatives, APTISI Transactions on Technopreneurship, 6, 2, pp. 270-284, (2024); Sundara Advanced Research on Artificial Intelligence, (2025); Haas, Peter M., Prospects for implementing the SDGs, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 56, (2022); Sharia Oikonomia Law Journal, (2024)","","Pandawan Sejahtera","","","","","","26568888; 26558807","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017879364"

The research employs a descriptive case study methodology using field data and adopting a juridical-empirical approach. Data collection is conducted through observation, interviews, and documentation, while data analysis encompasses data condensation, presentation, and conclusion. The findings indicate that the resilience of Islamic boarding schools in developing Sharia economic law stems from recognizing and strengthening their institutional autonomy. This includes acknowledging the roles of religious leaders, students, and the broader community in developing the pesantren-based Sharia economy. As centers of Sharia economic study and business practice, Islamic boarding schools are poised to serve as pivotal models in translating Sharia economic theory into practice. To enhance their role in this domain, several alternative solutions are proposed: firstly, the formulation of supplementary regulations emphasizing the study of economic law; secondly, the promotion of Islamic boarding schools as exemplars in fostering a Sharia economy within society; thirdly, the integration of Sharia economic law theory into the curriculum to optimize human resource development; and fourthly, the establishment of Islamic boarding schools as Sharia business laboratories capable of engaging in collaborative ventures. The contribution of this study lies in demonstrating how pesantren serve as contextual actors that bridge Islamic jurisprudence and socio-economic practice, offering a model for integrating fiqh al-muʿāmalāt into contemporary legal frameworks. This enriches academic discourse on Islamic law contextualisation while providing practical insights for policymakers, educators, and practitioners in strengthening Sharī ʿah economic governance in Indonesia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic Boarding School; Resilience; Sharia Economic Law","","","","The authors express their gratitude to State Islamic University (UIN) Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Indonesia, for academic support and facilities that enabled the completion of this study.

Findings show that AF, SIL, FTA, and FC are fundamental resources that are associated with sustainable performance in all three domains: Environmental (ESP), social (SSP), and financial (FSP) performance. These findings aim to equip SME management and policymakers with a robust practical framework for the execution of FinTech and improvement in internal and external controls, as well as managerial financial competencies. This will improve firms' access to finance and inform capacity-building programs, enabling policymakers to craft targeted FinTech regulatory frameworks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access to finance; Financial competencies; FinTech adoption; Firm's sustainable performance; Sustainable innovative leadership","article; capacity building; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; financial management; human; leadership; male; Pakistani; partial least squares regression; structural equation modeling","","","","Abbasi, Kaleemullah, P2P lending Fintechs and SMEs’ access to finance, Economics Letters, 204, (2021); Journal of Strategic Marketing, (2022); Abilawa, Aldi, Enhancing insight into fintech adoption through VOSViewer: A bibliometric exploration, Multidisciplinary Reviews, 7, 1, (2024); Aftab, Junaid, Organizational ambidexterity, firm performance, and sustainable development: Mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation in Pakistani SMEs, Journal of Cleaner Production, 367, (2022); Afum, Ebenezer, Exploring the link between green manufacturing, operational competitiveness, firm reputation and sustainable performance dimensions: a mediated approach, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 31, 7, pp. 1417-1438, (2020); Ahmad, Naveed, Sustainability as a “new normal” for modern businesses: Are smes of pakistan ready to adopt it?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-17, (2021); Aiello, Francesco, How firms finance innovation.

Since there is a dearth of literature on Islamic corporations, this study highlights the need for additional research on this topic. A new paradigm for future research was identified by reviewing the literature from 2014-2024. Publish or Perish (PoP) was used to gather the data, which were then organized according to the citation count. Visualizations and bibliometric analysis were aided by the VOSviewer program application. Research into Islamic corporate and financial literacy has slowed significantly over the last decade, peaking in 2021. The 151 items related to the two topics were grouped into 10 clusters out of the 998 papers identified. In particular, Islamic corporations adhere to sharia principles that stress the importance of fulfilling social responsibilities for the benefit of society. Stakeholders can gain a better understanding of financial literacy. Various new research paradigms pertaining to both subjects primarily teach us how to reach the objectives of Maqasid Al Shariah, good corporate governance, and corporate financial performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial literacy; islamic corporate; new paradigm learning","","","","","International Journal of Managerial Studies and Research, (2018); Abidin, Abidin, THE REGULATION OF ZAKAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IN CREATING COMMUNITY WELFARE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, 23, 5, pp. 1-9, (2020); Alexandro, Rinto, Measuring the effectiveness of smart digital organizations on digital technology adoption: An empirical study of educational organizations in Indonesia, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 8, 1, pp. 139-150, (2024); Alexandro, Rinto, The influence of macroeconomic infrastructure on supply chain smoothness and national competitiveness and its implications on a country's economic growth: evidence from BRICS countries, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 12, 1, pp. 167-180, (2024); Alzahrani, Mohammed, Islamic corporate finance, financial markets, and institutions: An overview, Journal of Corporate Finance, 55, pp. 1-5, (2019); Ansari, Yasmeen, A Study of Financial Literacy of Investors—A Bibliometric Analysis, International Journal of Financial Studies, 10, 2, (2022); Ziswaf Jurnal Zakat Dan Wakaf, (2022); Arruda, Humberto, VOSviewer and Bibliometrix, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 110, 3, pp. 392-395, (2022); World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology, (2012); Ashraf, Sumaira, Diversification of the Islamic stock market, Bitcoin, and Bullions in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 outbreak, Heliyon, 9, 8, (2023)","","Malque Publishing","","","","","","26751240","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005214540"

A total of 546 responses were collected across 13 Malaysian states via stratified random sampling and analysed using PLS-SEM. Results show that effort expectancy, social benefit, openness to change, and attitude significantly influence intention. Attitude also mediates the effects of performance and effort expectancy, economic and social benefit, regulatory support, and openness to change on intention. In contrast, social influence, and perceived security and privacy risks had no significant effect on attitude or intention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate UTAUT, meta-UTAUT, and VAM into a unified model for FinTech payment adoption.

The primary objective is to develop a low-cost, automated tree CAD modeling methodology combined with blockchain functionalities to support smart forest projects and collaborative design processes. The proposed method utilizes a parametric tree CAD model consisting of four 2D tree-frames with a 45° division angle, enriched with recorded tree-leaves’ texture and color. An “AI Text-by-Voice CAD Programming” technique is employed to create tangible tree-model NFT tokens, forming the basis of a thematic “Internet-of-Trees” blockchain. The main results demonstrate the effectiveness of the blockchain/Merkle hash tree in tracking tree geometry growth and texture changes through parametric transactions, enabling decentralized design, data validation, and planning intelligence. Comparative analysis highlights the advantages in cost, time efficiency, and flexibility over traditional 3D modeling techniques, while providing acceptable accuracy for metaverse projects in smart forests and landscape architecture. Core contributions include the integration of AI-based user voice interaction with blockchain and behavioral data for distributed and collaborative tree modeling, the introduction of a scalable and secure “Merkle hash tree” for smart forest monitoring, and the facilitation of fintech adoption in environmental projects.

In this domain, a question has been raised: In BCA strategies, is there any correlation between SEP performance and ECEAs and DEISIs in a mediating role? A serial mediation model was tested on a dataset of 630 WB and EU companies, and the research conceptual model was validated by CFA (Confirmation Factor Analysis), and the SEM (Structural Equation Model) fit was assessed. We found a statistically sound (significant, positive) correlation between BCA and ESG success performance, especially in the innovation and integrity ESG performance success indicators, when DEISIs mediate. The findings confirmed the influence of technology, and environmental, cultural, ethnic, and social factors on BCA strategy. The findings revealed some important issues of BCA that are of worth to WB companies’ managers to address BCA for better performance. This study adds to the literature on corporate blockchain transformation, especially for organizations seeking investment opportunities in new international markets to diversify their assets and skill pool.

It focuses on 26 listed Islamic and conventional banks across 11 countries in the MENA and Southeast Asia regions between 2020 and 2024. To measure digital adoption, we create a seven-component FinTech Adoption Index. We use fixed-effects regressions to examine its impact on cost efficiency, profitability, solvency stability, and credit risk. This analysis also controls bank size, capitalization, and macroeconomic conditions. The results show a clear adoption gap. Conventional banks consistently score 0.5–0.8 points higher on the FinTech Index compared to Islamic banks. Each additional FinTech component raised operating costs by about 0.8%, but improved profitability slightly by only 0.03%. This suggests that technological integration creates upfront costs before any real efficiency gains are seen. However, the stability benefits are stronger. FinTech adoption increases the Z-score by 3.6 points and lowers the non-performing loan ratio by 0.1%. Islamic banks gain more stability benefits due to their risk-sharing contracts and asset-backed financing structures. Overall, an efficiency–stability trade-off emerges. Conventional banks focus more on profitability, while Islamic banks gain resilience, but face slower efficiency improvements. By combining the Resource-Based View and Financial Stability Theory, this study provides the first multi-country evidence of how governance structures shape digital transformation in dual-banking markets. The findings offer practical guidance for regulators and bank managers around balancing innovation, efficiency, and stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; conventional banking; dual banking; efficiency; FinTech; Islamic banking; MENA; stability","","","","This study did not receive any special grant from public, commercial, or not-for-profit funding agencies.

In building on prior research, the study explores the hidden meanings of ML phenomena and connects them to the underlying financial motivation behind the actions of financial firms to create greater intellectual insight for users in practice. At its most basic, the study explores why the meaning and conception of ML is confusing and ambivalent for users in the sector. Through a scoping review, only top-tier quartile one publications between the years of 2014 to 2024 were chosen for the review with 167 articles selected for analysis. In making a significant contribution to theory, a classification framework was developed to provide greater meaning and clarification of different ML criteria. The study matches relevant CT criteria with the opportunities and challenges of ML identifying significant differences between theory and practice. The study thus substantially contributes to broadening and extending existing knowledge related to ML in the financial sector by better explaining what these gaps look like and what to do about them for future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Comprehending theory; Innovation; Machine learning","","","","","Artificial General Intelligence Agi Security Smart Applications and Sustainable Technologies, (2024); Hassan, M.

Since the impact of climate change significantly affects vulnerable regions such as Africa, achieving sustainable environment is paramount for the region. Therefore, this current study investigates the effects of financial technology (fintech), globalization, economic growth, and industry value added on renewable energy consumption in West Africa from 2000 to 2022 using the fixed and random effects, as well as the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) methods. The findings are as follows: first, fintech's impact on renewable energy consumption is negative and significant. Thus, at a 1 % significance level, fintech reduces renewable energy consumption by 0.0161. Second, the effect of economic growth on renewable energy consumption is insignificant, with a negative coefficient of 0.0044. Third, globalization has an insignificant effect on renewable energy consumption, with a negative coefficient of 0.0098. Fourth, industry value added with a positive coefficient of 0.0067 is not significant in affecting renewable energy consumption in the region. These findings encourage the incorporation of clean technologies in production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate change; Energy transition; Fintech; Globalization","Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy development; Energy economics; Industrial economics; Random processes; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; 'current; Economic growths; Energy transitions; Globalisation; Globalization economics; Negative coefficients; Renewable energies; Renewable energy consumption; Sustainable environment; Vulnerable regions; Fintech","","","","Elum, Zelda Anne, Climate change mitigation and renewable energy for sustainable development in Nigeria: A discourse approach, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 76, pp. 72-80, (2017); Jaiswal, Krishna Kumar, Renewable and sustainable clean energy development and impact on social, economic, and environmental health, Energy Nexus, 7, (2022); Polzin, Friedemann, Mobilizing private finance for low-carbon innovation – A systematic review of barriers and solutions, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 77, pp. 525-535, (2017); Poudineh, Rahmatallah, Advancing renewable energy in resource-rich economies of the MENA, Renewable Energy, 123, pp. 135-149, (2018); Hu, Mingjun, Does green finance promote low-carbon economic transition?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 427, (2023); Environ Sci Pollut Control Ser, (2023); Jayachandran, M., Challenges in achieving sustainable development goal 7: Affordable and clean energy in light of nascent technologies, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 53, (2022); Gyimah, Justice, Globalisation and renewable energy impact on carbon emissions in Ghana, International Journal of Global Warming, 28, 2, pp. 113-121, (2022); Hainsch, Karlo, Energy transition scenarios: What policies, societal attitudes, and technology developments will realize the EU Green Deal?, Energy, 239, (2022); International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","25901230","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010921688"

As a result, many rely on insecure informal systems, which results in user dissatisfaction in the long run. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, powered by blockchain technology, offer a promising alternative by enabling fast, low-cost, and highly secure transactions without the need for traditional banking institutions. This study empirically investigates how cryptocurrency adoption can enhance financial inclusion in Indonesia, both directly and indirectly through mediating factors such as user satisfaction, trust in financial institutions, and perceived economic empowerment. The study explores whether cryptocurrency use fosters financial autonomy, strengthens trust in digital financial services, and increases satisfaction with financial technologies—factors that may encourage broader participation in the formal financial system. Data were collected through a Google Form survey involving 147 respondents, Indonesian cryptocurrency investors. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, results reveal that while cryptocurrency adoption significantly improves user satisfaction, trust in the financial system, and economic empowerment, with scores of 0.888, 0.732, and 0.851, respectively. Cryptocurrency adoption also has a direct effect on financial inclusion, with a score of 0.635. However, perceived economic empowerment emerged as a strong mediating variable, with a score of 0.556 to financial inclusion, compared to user satisfaction with a mediating score of 0.282 to financial inclusion. These findings highlight that high economic empowerment is a key value driver for crypto investors. The results show platforms emphasizing accessibility, security, and transparency may be better positioned to support financial inclusion in emerging economies like Indonesia, without having to engage in a formal financial system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Investor; Partial Least Squares; Path Model; Trust in Financial Institutions","","","","The APC of this research was funded by Yayasan Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia (YPPI).","Abbasi, Ghazanfar Ali, The adoption of cryptocurrency as a disruptive force: Deep learning-based dual stage structural equation modelling and artificial neural network analysis, PLOS ONE, 16, 3 March 2021, (2021); Implementing the Digital Economy Enabling Environment Guide A Case Study from Indonesia, (2021); 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, (2021); 6th International Conference on Advanced Research in Arts Science Engineering Technology, (2021); Cao, Huining (Henry), Fintech, financial inclusion, digital currency, and CBDC, Journal of Finance and Data Science, 9, (2023); Global Findex Database 2017 Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution, (2018); Journal of Injury and Violence Research, (2011); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., Re-examining the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT): Towards a Revised Theoretical Model, Information Systems Frontiers, 21, 3, pp. 719-734, (2019); European Union Institute for Security Studies, (2021); El Amri, Mohamed Cherif, Analysis of Fatwas on FinTech, pp. 73-90, (2021)","","Centre for Research on Islamic Banking and Finance and Business","","","","","","26878518; 2687850X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015103240"

It promotes predictability and fairness in legal relations, establishing a framework for balancing private and public interests. In countries with transitional legal systems, such as Ukraine, property rights and contractual mechanisms face additional challenges as the global economy continues to evolve. Given the difficulties outlined above, there is a pressing need for research into how legal systems adjust to the ever-changing political, social, and economic climates. Property expectations are essential for public policy, economic Stability, and legal accountability. This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of existing studies on legally controlled expectations of property, with a particular focus on works published between 2019 and 2024. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework utilized in this study ensures openness and completeness of the process for selecting, excluding, and reviewing relevant material. Research was limited by the review scope, which included only peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and conference papers, ensuring the quality and credibility of the SLR. The findings of this study highlight research gaps, particularly in relation to socio-environmental factors and legislative changes in transition economies. In contrast, the current study emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach to address existing gaps.

Although numerous conventional models, such as SERVQUAL, have been widely used to measure service quality, they have also been criticized in general for their inability to document industry specifics and to reflect the evolving expectations of airline customers. To address these constraints, many authors have developed alternative methodologies that can be better adapted to the complicated context of the airline industry. This paper analyses established and evolving airline service quality models, scrutinizing the strengths, limitations, and implications of the models in the airline industry today. The paper adds to the current literature on the theoretical foundations and criticisms of service quality models, contributing to the continued improvement of service quality assessment instruments. Particular emphasis is placed on delineating the impact of service quality on satisfaction, behavioral loyalty, and psychological variables, such as price elasticity and perceptions of value. The findings of this study reveal the strategic role of service quality as a competitive advantage, especially in mature, price-sensitive markets. It suggests that a more defined, context-specific evaluation framework will help airlines to more closely match their level of service delivery with customer expectations. Overall, this paper recommends the development of more holistic and context-specific models to improve service quality measurement, facilitate strategic planning, and manage customer relationships in the airline industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Disclosure; Carbon Footprint; Displacement Matrix; Return Index","","","","","International Journal of Heritage Tourism and Hospitality, (2018); Journal of Law and Emerging Technologies, (2022); International Journal of Doctrine Judiciary and Legislation, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The constitutional framework for public policy in the Middle East and North Africa countries, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 7, 3, pp. 187-203, (2021); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, E-procurement in the international experience: an approach to reduce corruption in administrative contracts in Egypt, International Journal of Procurement Management, 15, 3, pp. 340-364, (2022); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, Policies and legal framework of involving small and medium enterprises in administrative contracts in Egypt: dynamics and influences, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 9, 1, pp. 61-74, (2022); Russian Law Journal, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The legal framework and policies for sustainable administrative contracts in Egypt: reality and challenges, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 9, 2, pp. 111-129, (2023); Central European Management Journal, (2023); Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023)","","Science Publishing Corporation Inc.","","","","","","23094508","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015193031"

This study examines the disclosure practices of Romanian-listed companies regarding accounting estimates, their correlation with financial performance, ESG scores, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Financial data was gathered from annual reports and those regarding the use of AI on companies’ websites. Financial performance was measured through profitability and liquidity indicators. The results of the statistical regressions showed that company size can influence AI disclosure; however, industry is not a strong predictor, and the number of employees does not significantly influence AI disclosure. A positive relationship was found between AI transparency and the current ratio, suggesting that companies disclosing more information about their AI use may have higher current liquidity. Additionally, a statistically significant negative relationship was observed between the AI disclosure score and net profit, indicating that greater AI transparency is associated with lower net income.

This study addresses critical challenges in cloud security by proposing a novel framework that integrates blockchain-based smart contracts to enhance authorization and authentication processes. Smart contracts, as self-executing agreements embedded with predefined rules, enable decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof mechanisms for managing access control in cloud environments. The proposed system mitigates prevalent threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and identity theft through an immutable and auditable security framework. A prototype system, developed using Ethereum blockchain and Solidity programming, demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Rigorous evaluations reveal significant improvements in key metrics: security, with a 0% success rate for unauthorized access attempts; scalability, maintaining low response times for up to 100 concurrent users; and usability, with an average user satisfaction rating of 4.4 out of 5. These findings establish the efficacy of smart contract-based solutions in addressing critical vulnerabilities in cloud services while maintaining operational efficiency. The study underscores the transformative potential of blockchain and smart contracts in revolutionizing cloud security practices. Future research will focus on optimizing the system’s scalability for higher user loads and integrating advanced features such as adaptive authentication and anomaly detection for enhanced resilience across diverse cloud platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","authentication; authorization; blockchain technology; cloud security; decentralized access control; smart contracts","Anomaly detection; Blockchain; Cloud platforms; Cloud security; Decentralized control; Scalability; Smart contract; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Cloud securities; Cloud services; Critical challenges; Decentralized access control; Robust access control; Security mechanism; Service demand; Unauthorized access; Authentication","","","This study is supported by Department of Information Technology, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, 71491, Saudi Arabia.","Khalil, Usman, Leveraging a novel NFT-enabled blockchain architecture for the authentication of IoT assets in smart cities, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Taherdoost, Hamed, Smart Contracts in Blockchain Technology: A Critical Review, Information (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2023); Jiang, Fan, Enhancing Smart-Contract Security through Machine Learning: A Survey of Approaches and Techniques, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2023); Karagwal, Shreya, Blockchain for Internet of Things (IoT): Research Issues, Challenges, and Future Directions, EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing, pp. 15-34, (2023); Migration Letters, (2023); Ethics in A Digital World Ab Magazine, (2023); Reyes, Alvaro, Continuous and Secure Integration Framework for Smart Contracts, Sensors, 23, 1, (2023); Pasqua, Michele, Enhancing Ethereum smart-contracts static analysis by computing a precise Control-Flow Graph of Ethereum bytecode, Journal of Systems and Software, 200, (2023); Play and Games for Transformational Innovation in the Ontario Healthcare System, (2020); Alevizos, Lampis, Blockchain-Enabled Intrusion Detection and Prevention System of APTs Within Zero Trust Architecture, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 89270-89288, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013348663"

Despite the economic potential of spices such as cardamom and clove, smallholder farmers remain marginalized in price negotiations, bound by informal credit schemes and buyer-controlled market structures. Grounded in the framework of Islamic economics, which emphasizes justice (‘add) and prohibits exploitation (shikar), this research explores how these unethical practices persist and affect farmers’ livelihoods. Using a qualitative descriptive method, data were collected through semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and analysis of local trade documents involving 30 stakeholders: farmers, collectors, and village officials. The findings reveal a pervasive system of price suppression, enforced dependency, and income instability, exacerbated by asymmetric information and power dynamics. Such arrangements not only hinder market fairness but also contradict Islamic ethical norms on transparency, voluntary exchange, and mutual benefit. The study contributes to the literature by integrating Islamic moral economy with empirical analysis of rural market behav-ior. It proposes actionable strategies, including local price regulation (tastier), cooperative-based collective bargaining, and sharia-compli-ant financing models to restore justice and empower producers.

While prior studies have addressed e-commerce in Islamic legal discourse, few have examined the transformation of ʿurf (customary practice) as a legitimate legal source in the digital age. This study introduces the DigitalʿUrf Alignment Model (DUAM), an integrative legal-epistemological framework that systematizes the adaptation of classical ʿurf to digital contexts through maqāṣid al-sharīʿah based validation. Employing a qualitative-normative approach, the research analyzes Fatwa No. 146/2021, issued by the National Sharia Council of the Indonesian Ulema Council (DSN-MUI), classical and contemporary fiqh sources, and emerging digital transaction models. It integrates concepts from uṣūl al-fiqh, maqāṣid al-sharī‘ah, and socio-philosophical reasoning to reconceptualize ʿurf as a dynamic category of legal interpretation. The findings affirm that digital ʿurf, structured through DUAM, enables its institutionalization as a normative legal source for fatwa and provides a scalable method for integrating classical jurisprudence with digital finance regulations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contemporary Islamic Law; Digital ʿUrf; DSN-MUI Fatwa; E-Commerce; Maqāṣid al-Sharī‘ah","","","","","Al Taqrib Bain Al Qawaid Al Usuliyyah Fima La Nassa Fih, (2008); Badai Al Sanai, (2025); Rawat Al Libn Dr Ibn A, (2019); Nazariyyat Al Maqasid Ind Al Imam Al Shatibi, (1992); Al Muwafaqat Fi Usul Al Ahkam, (2004); Al Ashbah Wa Al Naza Ir; Dilalat Al Nusus Wa Turuq Istimbat Al Ahkam Fi Daw Usul Al Fiqh Al Islami, (1983); Usul Al Fiqh Al Islami, (1986); Al Fiqh Al Islami Wa Adillatuh, (1997); Alkhan, Ahmed Mansoor, Does Islamic microfinance serve maqāsid al-shari'a?, Borsa Istanbul Review, 21, 1, pp. 57-68, (2021)","","Universitas Islam Negeri Profesor Kiai Haji Saifuddin Zuhri Purwokerto","","","","","","19786670; 25794167","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011201632"

The regression results show that GDP growth and exchange rates positively influence hajj fund assets (p<0.05), while BI-7 Day Reverse Repo Rate, inflation, and Jakarta Islamic Index negatively affect fund assets. Dynamic system simulations reveal that under current conditions (ROI 6.78%, subsidy portion 40%), hajj funds will face deficit by 2030. However, optimistic scenarios with increased ROI to 10% and reduced subsidy portions to 20% ensure fund sustainability until 2050, with assets reaching IDR 569 trillion.

The results show that bank-level financial performance measures, particularly loan ratio, profitability, and market power, outperform macroeconomic factors in forecasting credit risk. Among the models tested, CatBoost was more accurate and explainable, as confirmed by SHAP-based explainability analysis.

With a descriptive-analytical qualitative approach, this research uses primary data from in-depth interviews and secondary data from official documents to understand the implementation and impact of the fatwa. The research results show that the DSN MUI fatwa provides important legal certainty for Muslims, ensuring that the use of electronic money follows Sharia principles such as the prohibition of usury, gharar, and haram transactions. In addition, this fatwa emphasizes security and transparency in transactions, increasing public trust in the digital financial system and supporting financial inclusion by enabling access to modern financial services for people previously unreachable by conventional banking. In conclusion, the DSN MUI fatwa supported the adaptation of Islamic law to the development of modern financial technology, ensuring the integration of technological innovation in the lives of Muslims without sacrificing their religious values.

Cloud technologies are an integral part of digital innovations that these institutions use in their activities. These technologies are in active development and adaptation to the specifics of the functioning of different financial intermediaries, in particular commercial banks. The article pays special attention to the study of using cloud technologies in the work of banking institutions, taking into account the specifics of their economic activity and their role in the development of the financial system and the national economy. For this purpose, the key characteristics of using cloud technologies are determined, and the specific features of the economic activity of commercial banks are substantiated, taking into account the possibilities of using artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, the role of cloud computing technologies in the modern development of banking institutions in the informational security system was analyzed. To understand the ambiguity of the consequences of using cloud technologies and the positive and negative consequences of their use in the work of commercial banks, the research was conducted. As a result, it is established that cloud technologies already today are already indispensable components of the development of any commercial bank. Thanks to their application using the potential of digital technologies and, in combination with the construction of effective systems, digital transformation is possible, to ensure high-level competitiveness and dynamic, regulated bank development in the conditions of digitalization of economic relationships and change of established models functioning of the financial market services. The article formulates promising directions for the use and adaptation of cloud technologies by commercial banks, taking into account their opportunities and threats. It is also determined that the gradual growth of demand from these institutions for relevant services will contribute to the emergence of new changes in the cloud services market, taking into account their capabilities to form such demand and the scale of their activities, which also determine the need to build effective information systems for their work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","banking institution; banking service; cloud technologies; digital technology; digitalization; financial services market","","","","This research is carried out within the framework of the scientific project \u201CModel of post-war development of credit institutions based on artificial intelligence: customization of financial services and prudential supervision\u201D with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.","Journal of Lifestyle and Sdgs Review, (2024); Afgani, Kurnia Fajar, Risk Management Practices and the Performance of Indonesian and Malaysian Islamic Banks: Does Digitalization Mediate This Nexus?, Thunderbird International Business Review, 66, 6, pp. 567-581, (2024); Ambekar, Archana M., Shaping society 5.0 with smart banking solutions over cloud: Need, impacts, and technology, pp. 593-616, (2025); Ayadi, Rym, Digitalization and banks' efficiency: Evidence from a European analysis, International Review of Financial Analysis, 97, (2025); Bassens, David, Banking in the cloud: mapping big tech’s global digital technology networks, Regional Studies, 58, 12, pp. 2241-2255, (2024); Begimkulov, Emil, The Impact of Bank Competition on Stability in Central Asia: The Moderating Role of Bank Digitalization, Public Finance Quarterly, 71, 1, pp. 87-106, (2025); Biswas, Ankur, Decentralized Cloud Banking: Empowering Security and Efficiency with Blockchain, IPFS, and Smart Card Technology, International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering, 12, 3s, pp. 31-47, (2024); Li, Chengming, DIGITALIZATION AND THE “TOO BIG TO FAIL” DILEMMA: MECHANISMS AND ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS OF BANKS’ FINTECH INNOVATION ON TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 30, 2, pp. 464-488, (2024); Cloud Computing in Banking Things to Consider When Moving to the Cloud; Cui, Qi, The Impact of Digitalization via Broadband Expansion on Bank Transparency, SAGE Open, 15, 2, (2025)","","Precarpathian National University","","","","","","24132349; 23110155","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010262183"

Originating from decision theory, systems thinking, and complexity science, it supports informed judgment in uncertain environments. Despite its broad application, previous research on accounting and auditing reforms has predominantly concentrated on stable economies, with minimal emphasis on countries recovering from conflict. This study examines the future trajectories of accounting and auditing practices in post-war Ukraine using a scenario analysis framework. Data were collected through the Delphi method, incorporating expert interviews and survey questionnaires. Analytical techniques included the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), supplemented by bootstrapping for result validation. The analysis reveals that Scenario 1, referred to as ""Digital Reinvention,"" has a statistically significant impact on the projected development of accounting and auditing in Ukraine's post-war context. In contrast, Scenarios 2 and 3, labeled ""Gradual Compliance"" and ""Regulatory Stagnation,"" do not exhibit significant associations with the evolution of the field. The findings indicate that the three exogenous variables together explain approximately 41.2% of the total variance in the endogenous variable, demonstrating a moderate predictive capacity of the model. This suggests that Ukraine’s post-conflict financial landscape is likely to be influenced predominantly by digital transformation, institutional modernization, full adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the implementation of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies to enhance financial transparency and audit reliability in the emerging economic environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Transformation; Auditing; Auditing Methodologies; Economic Resilience; Financial Transparency; Forecast; Post-Conflict Recovery; Ukraine","","","","","Post War Reconstruction in Ukraine within Corporate Finance Framework Un Sdg Aspect, (2024); Bašić, Sanela Cekic, Social Work in a Post-war Dystopia: A Case Study of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Journal of Human Rights and Social Work, 9, 3, pp. 410-417, (2024); Bolesta, Andrzej, From socialism to capitalism with communist characteristics: the building of a post-socialist developmental state in Central Asia, Post-Communist Economies, 34, 1, pp. 71-98, (2022); Blythe, Jessica L., Fostering ocean empathy through future scenarios, People and Nature, 3, 6, pp. 1284-1296, (2021); Futurity Economics Law, (2021); Castleberry, Ashley N., Thematic analysis of qualitative research data: Is it as easy as it sounds?, Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning, 10, 6, pp. 807-815, (2018); Cordova-Pozo, Kathya Lorena, Types of scenario planning and their effectiveness: A review of reviews, Futures, 149, (2023); Edwards, Robert D., Technical analysis of stock trends, Eleventh edition, pp. 1-638, (2018); Eichhorn, Theresa, Exploring macro-environmental factors influencing adoption of result-based and collective agri-environmental measures: a PESTLE approach based on stakeholder statements, Bio-based and Applied Economics, 13, 1, pp. 49-71, (2024); Complexity in Economics, (2024)","","Centre for Research on Islamic Banking and Finance and Business","","","","","","26878518; 2687850X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011582429"

The development of this industry is influenced by ongoing efforts to harmonize DSN-MUI fatwas with OJK regulations, aiming to enhance Sharia compliance and legal certainty. Through DSN-MUI fatwas (2008–2021) and POJK regulations (2016, 2022), religious and state authorities have worked to enhance legal certainty and consumer protection in the Sharia-based digital finance sector. This study adopts a qualitative approach through literature-based document analysis to examine how DSN-MUI fatwas and OJK regulations contribute to developing the Sharia FinTech industry. The research findings indicate that while fatwas offer normative guidance for Sharia compliance, challenges persist in areas such as financial literacy, technological readiness, and regulatory oversight effectiveness. The findings suggest a need for clearer regulations, improved public education, and more effective use of technology to enhance the transparency and efficiency of Sharia financial services. Stronger collaboration between financial regulators and religious institutions can improve the capacity of Sharia FinTech to support financial inclusion and contribute to sustainable growth in the Islamic economy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fatwa DSN-MUI; Inclusive; Innovative; OJK Regulation; Sharia FinTech","","","","This research was funded by Beasiswa Indonesia Bangkit (BIB), a collaborative programme between the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and the Education Fund Management Institution (Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan, LPDP) under the Ministry of Finance.

AI includes the development of trading bots, the implementation of automated risk management systems, and the use of predictive analytics tools that optimize trading operations. This is important, as AI technology plays a crucial role in the rapid analysis of huge amounts of data to predict market prices and trading opportunities, thereby increasing the efficiency of investments. In addition, AI provides investors with real-time information and assists in risk management. However, there are objective difficulties, and crypto fraudsters study different scenarios and adapt to changing market conditions using AI. By using the methods of observation, generalization, systematization and comparison, the authors have achieved results in determining the significance of implementation. In particular, the integration of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies can be applied, which aims to use the capabilities of big data processing and continuous learning to create a more efficient trading environment and financial services. The results presented in this paper give grounds to assert that it is possible to implement in the real business and technological environment (exchanges, crypto-exchanges, cryptocurrency operations, IT infrastructure, big data, AI). The article proposes innovative models and applications of artificial intelligence for use in trading business operations, where the main tool for users is generative artificial intelligence and interfaces. This method makes it possible to define generative artificial intelligence and natural language interfaces as the main means for trading operations that will be carried out using cryptocurrencies.

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of 78 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Web of Science published between 2018 and 2024, the study uncovers regulatory inconsistencies across regions, including (under Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations), ASEAN (through OJK’s gold mandate), and Saudi Arabia, thereby impeding the international adoption of blockchain technology for Shariah compliance. While blockchain technology enhances transparency and compliance through smart contracts, it also introduces cybersecurity risks and conflicts with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Furthermore, Shariah compliance continues to be a subject of contention, with Saudi Arabia raising concerns regarding the classification of intangible assets. In this regard, the review proposes the implementation of an AI-driven liquidity model framework, advocating for a tiered regulatory approach in advanced economies and the establishment of central bank safeguards in emerging markets, while ensuring ethical considerations. By leveraging GBCs, stakeholders can unlock their potential as an inclusive and resilient financial instrument.

The aim of the research is to analyse and explain how these disruptions affect financial performance indicators, such as Return on Assets (ROA), company stability, and market value. The research employed a panel data model, where the dependent variable is the financial performance of the companies and disruptions in accounting are the independent variables. The data were collected from publicly available financial statements, audit reports, and macroeconomic indicators. The study applied a fixed-effect and random-effect regression model to measure the relationship between disruptions in accounting and financial indicators. Company size, industry type, and other macroeconomic conditions (e.g., Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth) are control variables. Disruptions in accounting have a significant negative impact on financial performance, including restatements, reporting delays, and qualified audit opinions, which causes a decrease in ROA. GDP growth is a macroeconomic factor that positively affects financial performance, while company size mitigates the negative impact of accounting accuracy on performance. The results show that accurate and timely financial reporting is important for maintaining investor confidence and financial stability.

The research focuses on three primary determinants: demographic characteristics, knowledge of digital assets, and the perceived risks associated with their usage and transfer. Utilizing a quantitative research design, data were collected from 630 Thai respondents via a structured online questionnaire through convenience sampling. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify statistically significant predictors. The results indicate that digital-asset knowledge, gender, age, income, saving behavior, and risk perception collectively account for a substantial variance in individuals’ intentions to use digital assets as part of their inheritance planning. Notably, knowledge and income positively influence adoption, suggesting that financial education and broader economic development may encourage increased usage. Conversely, factors such as age, gender, and perception of risks pose significant barriers, underscoring the need for targeted strategies to foster inclusivity. As digital assets transition from speculative tools to recognized financial instruments, their role in inheritance planning becomes increasingly relevant.

Thus, it is important to investigate the factors underlying SMEs’ decision to adopt Fintech. Background Problem: Previous studies have applied various theoretical frameworks to explore Fintech adoption. Despite this, limited knowledge exists regarding the determinants influencing the adoption of Fintech among SMEs. Novelty: By using innovation diffusion theory, this study examines the underlying elements that contribute to the adoption of Fintech by SMEs. Research Methods: Data were collected using the survey approach. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to SMEs in Indonesia using purposive sampling, yielding 273 responses. The data were then analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. Findings/Results: The results confirmed all hypotheses developed for the study. Specifically, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability positively affect attitude towards Fintech adoption. In turn, positive attitude towards the adoption of Fintech has a significant impact on the intention to use Fintech. In addition, attitude mediates the relationship between IDT factors (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability) and Fintech adoption intention. Conclusion: Innovation diffusion theory is able to explain the factors that form SMEs' attitude and adoption intention toward Fintech. The outcomes of this research provide important implications both theoretically and practically. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption intention; Financial technology; innovation diffusion theory","","","","","Abbasi, Kaleemullah, FinTech, SME efficiency and national culture: Evidence from OECD countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2021); Abdul-Rahim, Ruzita, Benefit–Risk Perceptions of FinTech Adoption for Sustainability from Bank Consumers’ Perspective: The Moderating Role of Fear of COVID-19, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022); Acikgoz, Fulya, Curiosity on Cutting-Edge Technology via Theory of Planned Behavior and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 3, 1, (2023); Alhammadi, Khadija, Assessing the effect of innovation diffusion and technology readiness theories on attitude, behavioral intention and implementation of smart learning, Cross Cultural and Strategic Management, 30, 4, pp. 657-675, (2023); Ali, Muhammad, Consumer acceptance toward takaful in Pakistan: An application of diffusion of innovation theory, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 14, 4, pp. 620-638, (2019); Alkhawaldeh, Bashar Younis, The effect of financial technology on financial performance in Jordanian SMEs: The role of financial satisfaction, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 11, 3, pp. 1019-1030, (2023); Arli, Denni I., Exploring the role of innovation attributes on mobile payment adoption, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 40, 7, pp. 826-841, (2023); Chibuogwu, Ashinze Paul, A multidimensional model of sustainable renewable energy linking purchase intentions, attitude and user behavior in nigeria, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 19, (2021); Badi, Sulafa M., Technological, organisational and environmental determinants of smart contracts adoption: UK construction sector viewpoint, Construction Management and Economics, 39, 1, pp. 36-54, (2021); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019)","","Gadjah Mada University","","","","","","23385847; 20858272","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007538802"

However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a meta-analytic comparison of these technologies' effectiveness within the sector. The study aims to bridge the gap by conducting a meta-analysis, assessing the impact of AI and blockchain on various aspects of financial risk management. The study includes a meta-analysis approach, systematically synthesizing findings from recent studies on blockchain and AI in financial risk management. Following strict inclusion criteria, a comprehensive search through Scopus and Google Scholar led to the selection of 36 studies for analysis. The forest plots and summary tables were generated using Meta-Essentials, a statistical tool for meta-analyses that calculates effect sizes, confidence intervals, and pooled esti-mates using fixed and random effects models for accurate interpretation. The meta-analysis revealed that blockchain technology enhances financial security and transpar-ency, particularly post-COVID, addressing operational risks with a modest but non-sig-nificant effect (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99-1.10, p = 0.11). AI demonstrated a neutral impact on risk management (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.04, p = 0.71) but excelled in fraud detection and predictive analytics. Funnel plot analysis showed minimal publication bias, and forest plots confirmed consistent findings across studies.

The primary objective is to evaluate how AI can be integrated to enhance risk assessment effectiveness while ensuring compliance with Islamic legal principles (Fiqh), particularly the prohibition of Riba, the avoidance of Gharar, and the promotion of ethical transparency. A qualitative methodology with a descriptive analytical approach is employed in this research. Data sources include scholarly literature, regulatory policies, industry reports, and case studies related to AI adoption in Islamic finance. The analysis utilizes the IFAS and EFAS to assess internal and external factors influencing AI adoption. Additionally, an Islamic legal analysis is conducted to ensure that AI implementation aligns with Shariah principles. The findings reveal that AI has significant potential to enhance efficiency and innovation in Islamic finance. However, challenges such as infrastructure limitations and a lack of technological literacy pose obstacles to its implementation. From an external perspective, opportunities for financial inclusion and strategic technological partnerships are expanding, yet concerns regarding data security and regulatory uncertainties remain prevalent. From an Islamic legal standpoint, this study underscores the importance of developing an AI framework that adheres to Shariah principles. The adoption of AI in Islamic finance must follow a balanced approach by leveraging external opportunities, addressing internal challenges, and ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards. This study offers strategic insights into AI integration within Islamic finance, contributing to its sustainability and global competitiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Islamic Financing; Islamic Legal Perspective","","","","","Abdullah, Othman, AI APPLICATIONS FOR FIQH RULINGS IN ISLAMIC BANKS: SHARĪʿAH COMMITTEE ACCEPTANCE, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 16, 1, pp. 111-126, (2024); Integrating Risk Management in Fintech and Traditional Financial Institutions Through AI and Machine Learning, (2024); Abozaid, Abdulazeem Jalal, Financial applications of artificial intelligence: Shariah issues and maqasid considerations, pp. 165-189, (2024); Adznana, Syaima, Islamic banking and the fourth industrial revolution: The current application, adoption, and future challenges of artificial intelligence, pp. 207-219, (2024); Al Qasimia University Journal of Islamic Economics, (2023); Al-Mulla, Amna, Sustainable financing for entrepreneurs: Case study in designing a crowdfunding platform tailored for Qatar, Digital Business, 2, 2, (2022); Kocatepe Slami Limler Dergisi, (2023); Alam, Nafis, Fintech and Islamic finance: Digitalization, development and disruption, pp. 1-178, (2019); Ali, Mohammad Mahbubi, Islamic financial inclusion determinants in Indonesia: an ANP approach, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 13, 4, pp. 727-747, (2020); Alsaghir, Mohammad, Digital risks and Islamic FinTech: a road map to social justice and financial inclusion, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, (2023)","","State Institute for Islamic Studies Curup","","","","","","25483374; 25483382","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005540741"

A qualitative research method is adopted in this study to address the concept of e-wallet, Sharīʿah contracts, issues, and challenges from the Sharīʿah perspective. The collected data of this study is analyzed through an explanatory research approach to fulfill the objectives of this study. The study finds that the Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet is realizable from the Sharīʿah perspective. Although a wadīʿah contract is used for deposit/safekeeping purposes, in this study the concept of qarḍ seems to be a better choice for a contract between user and issuer. However, the cashback and rewards are some issues that arise while using the qarḍ contract since a borrower (issuer) is not allowed to return additional benefits/amount to the lender. In this regard, the study concludes that the benefits of e-wallets either might come from the merchant or the issuer. If those benefits are given by the issuer out of his generosity, and without any condition from the borrower (user), the offer of such benefits will be permissible, on the other hand, if it comes in return for a condition, that will be impermissible. Moreover, the benefits provided by the merchants seem to be permissible due to sale contracts in that transaction. The study also finds that a Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet is required to transfer the funds to a trust account under an Islamic financial institution so that it does not issue an interest for that fund. Additionally, if the fund is allowed to invest, it should be invested in a Sharīʿah compliant investment. The results of this study assist the e-wallet providers to consider Sharīʿah compliance of the e-wallet. In particular, the findings reveal the possibilities of Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet regardless of the issues and challenges it might face. Moreover, it provides room for users who are Islamic fintech enthusiasts. This research presents a deeper insight into wadīʿah and qarḍ contract to be used as underlying contracts between e-wallet providers and users. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cashback; E-Wallet; qarḍ; rewards; Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet","","","","","Bitara International Journal of Civilizational Studies and Human Sciences, (2022); Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Public Policy and Social Science Icops 2021, (2021); International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration, (2025); Aji, Hendy Mustiko, How e-wallets encourage excessive spending behavior among young adult consumers?, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 16, 6, pp. 868-884, (2022); Aji, Hendy Mustiko, The effects of subjective norm and knowledge about riba on intention to use e-money in Indonesia, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 12, 6, pp. 1180-1196, (2021); Alam, Md Mahmudul, Using e-wallet for business process development: challenges and prospects in Malaysia, Business Process Management Journal, 27, 4, pp. 1142-1162, (2021); Asna Al Matalib Fi Sharh Rawd Al Talib; Kashf Al Qina an Matn Al Iqna, (2025); Sharh Munthaa Al Iradat, (2000); A Al Bukhr","","Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","","","","","","25904396; 19857454","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008354281"

The study is driven by the need for Sharia-compliant institutions to enhance efficiency and ensure adherence to Sharia principles in fiduciary oversight. AI has the potential to expedite analysis and accurately detect fiduciary breaches. The research examines internal and external factors influencing AI adoption while identifying potential benefits and challenges. From an internal perspective, strengths such as operational efficiency and compliance with Sharia principles are predominant, with a total IFAS score of 1.17, indicating that strengths outweigh weaknesses in AI implementation. Externally, factors like government regulatory support for digitalization and the growth of Sharia fintech offer significant opportunities, reflected in an EFAS score of 1.23. However, there are threats to consider, including rapid regulatory changes and potential security risks. Overall, the application of AI in fiduciary supervision, in line with Islamic law principles, can positively impact both conventional and Islamic financial sectors. With an effective implementation strategy, internal and external challenges can be managed, allowing for the optimization of AI technology that aligns with principles of justice and transparency in Islamic law, thereby enhancing accountability and public trust in Sharia-compliant institutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Fiduciary; Islamic Legal Principles","","","","","Agung, I.

The data were collected during the years 2022/23 from 370 experts in finance, accounting, and auditing of businesses in Kosovo, while their processing was done through exploratory factorial analysis (EFA), confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA), and modeling of structural equations (SEM) using SPSS and AMOS programs. The results indicate that there are symbiotic relationships through direct and indirect effects on the factors, therefore digitalization has a positive effect on finance, accounting, and reporting. Specifically, the digitalization of expenses and cost planning (DECP) has a direct effect on the digitalization of transactions, financial reporting, and monitoring (DTFRM). This effect contributes to improvement, transparency, and decision making (DITDM). However, the DTFRM factor does not have a direct effect on the DITDM factor but has a mediated effect on the effect of DECP on DITDM. This means that in order to enhance improvement, transparency, and decision making (DITDM), the digitalization of expenses and cost planning (DECP) should also include financial transactions, financial reporting, and control processes (DTFRM). Therefore, the study highlights that digitalization plays a significant role in improving financial, accounting, and auditing processes as a strategic move to enhance their financial management capabilities, transparency, decision making, and control. For future studies, it is emphasized to conduct in depth research and analysis to better understand the complex relationship between DTFRM and DITDM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Digitalization; Finance; Reporting; Symbiotic Relationships","","","","","Afuah, Allan N., Redefining firm boundaries in the face of the internet: Are firms really shrinking?, Academy of Management Review, 28, 1, pp. 34-53, (2003); Agyenim-Boateng, Cletus, The role of structure in manipulating PPP accountability, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 1, pp. 119-144, (2017); Allain, Élodie, Explaining implementation difficulties associated with activity-based costing through system uses, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 19, 1, pp. 181-198, (2018); Amonoo Nkrumah, Beatrice, Stakeholder accountability in the era of big data: an exploratory study of online platform companies, Qualitative Research in Accounting and Management, 20, 4, pp. 447-484, (2023); Azam, Md Shah, Diffusion of ICT and SME performance, Advances in Business Marketing and Purchasing, 23A, pp. 7-290, (2015); Bai, Chunguang, COVID-19 pandemic digitization lessons for sustainable development of micro-and small- enterprises, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 1989-2001, (2021); Ben Bouheni, Faten, An econometric understanding of Fintech and operating performance, Review of Accounting and Finance, 22, 3, pp. 329-352, (2023); Bi, Gongbing, The impact of information transparency on trade credit: the mediation role of risk, Kybernetes, 53, 1, pp. 27-57, (2024); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2016); Bilal, Bilal, Do the educational profile, gender, and professional experience of audit committee financial experts improve financial reporting quality?, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 53, (2023)","","Sciendo","","","","","","18424120; 23445416","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005635057"

In this context, fintechs represent a vector of exponential change in the global financial system and its institutions. However, despite the existing relationship between fintechs and institutions, there is a need for more studies exploring the connections between them. Beginning with a framework that integrates aspects of the relation between fintechs and institutions in the financial system, the objective of this article is to empirically demonstrate the interaction between fintechs and financial system institutions in an emerging country. To do so, the chosen research method was an embedded case study, which involved documental analysis and semi-structured interviews conducted with different agents in the Brazilian financial system, belonging to the following categories: technology providers, fintechs, regulatory institutions, financial institutions, and consumers. The findings validate the applicability of the theoretical framework, highlighting that fintechs drive institutional changes across stakeholders with different characteristic traits. Based on these results, we created theoretical propositions that guide future studies on the topic of fintechs and institutions. This study’s contributions provide valuable insights for financial policymakers, regulators, and technology providers, particularly regarding the adaptation of regulatory frameworks and technological infrastructures in emerging economies.

This product operates on a profit-sharing principle, distinguishing it from conventional deposits relying on interest-based systems. The profit-sharing mechanism helps Islamic banks avoid the adverse spread risk faced by conventional banks and changes the legal relationship between depositors and banks. This study addresses the shift in the legal relationship from a creditor-debtor model, as seen in conventional banks, to a partnership-based model in Islamic banking, emphasising equal profit sharing. The research examines the legal construction of this partnership, where the depositor entrusts funds to the bank, which manages them following Sharia principles. Using a normative legal method, the study draws on data from legal documents and regulations to analyse the protections provided to depositors, focusing on compliance with Islamic law and the bank's fiduciary responsibility. The result highlights that depositors in Mudharabah schemes receive enhanced legal protection, benefiting from better governance, risk management, and adherence to Sharia principles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic Banking; Legal Protection; Legal Relationship; Mudharabah Deposit; Profit-Sharing","","","","","Petita Jurnal Kajian Ilmu Hukum Dan Syariah, (2020); Ahmad, Muneer, Consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking: decision-making analysis through AHP, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 15, 5, pp. 1280-1302, (2024); Al Hikmah International Journal of Islamic Studies and Human Sciences, (2023); Akbar, M.

As time goes by, classical waqf, which generally focuses on immovable objects such as land and buildings, faces challenges in adapting to developments in information technology and modern financial systems. Traditional endowment management systems often lack transparency, which can reduce public trust. Digital waqf emerged as an alternative to answer the need for flexibility and efficiency in managing endowment assets. However, based on previous research, digital waqf, considered an alternative solution, tends to experience a shift in concept, where most implementations focus more on collecting funds than basic Islamic social principles, such as transparency and sustainable management. of research findings obtained using the literature review method: namely, Firstly, digital waqf significantly differs significantly different from classical waqf in terms of mechanisms, instruments, and management This innovation simplifies the endowment process through technology but it raises new challenges related to Sharia supervision and understanding contracts. Second, digital Waqf can distort concepts, such as adjusting contracts that are not by sharia and in practice, such as a lack of management transparency. However, this potential distortion can be minimized with appropriate regulations and technology implementation. Third, digital waqf can be adapted to Sharia principles if it meets the requirements for a valid contract, management transparency, and sustainability of endowment assets. Technologies such as blockchain and Sharia auditing play an important role in ensuring this compliance. With a careful approach and cross-sector collaboration, digital waqf can become an important instrument for empowering communities and supporting sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classic Waqf; Digital Waqf; Distortion; Innovation; Sharia Principles","","","","","Roziq, Ahmad, An Escalation Model of Muzakki’s Trust and Loyalty towards Payment of Zakat at BAZNAS Indonesia, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 3, pp. 551-559, (2021); Sawmar, Abdulsalam Ahmed, How Governance Practices Influence Mandatory Zakah Payment in Saudi Arabia?, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 34, 1, pp. 3-24, (2021); Lan Tabur Jurnal Ekonomi Syariah, (2021); Peran Teknologi Dalam Optimalisasi Pengumpulan Dan Distribusi Zakat Dan Wakaf, (2024); Journal of Islamic Economics, (2015); Al Infaq Jurnal Ekonomi Islam, (2022); Ultra Petita and the Threat to Constitutional Justice the Indonesian Experience, (2018); Armia, Muhammad Siddiq, Public caning: Should it be maintained or eliminated?

SMEs are increasingly implementing sustainable business models to tackle resource constraints and environmental issues to foster long-term social and environmental impact. A quantitative research design was employed, with data collected through questionnaires distributed to SME owners using purposive sampling. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed, with 106 valid responses analyzed. The study employed descriptive statistics and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS 4.0 to assess the framework. The findings reveal significant positive effects of financial institutions, globalization impact, and access to finance on the role of waqf in SME development, while business obstacles and government support showed no significant influence. According to this study, open innovation is crucial to fostering collaboration between small- and medium-sized enterprises, Islamic endowments, and external stakeholders such as non-profits, government agencies, and community groups.

Furthermore, global price fluctuations—often beyond the control of local governments—exacerbate domestic price volatility. The rice supply chain in East Java exhibits a complex structure, heavily dependent on intermediaries (middlemen) who dominate distribution channels and suppress grain prices. This dominance by intermediaries leads to profit disparities and diminishes farmers' incentives to increase production and improve harvest quality. Using a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD), this research identifies a reinforcing feedback loop that perpetuates import dependency and a balancing loop facilitated by BULOG's strategic role in price stabilization and stock management. Dynamic simulations under three import policy scenarios (Import Policy Factors of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8) reveal the significant effects of these policies on BULOG's stock levels, domestic production, import volumes, agricultural land-use and domestic rice prices. The Import Policy Factor 0.2 scenario supports domestic production, achieving output levels of up to 5,512,795 tons while minimizing dependence on imports, stabilizing domestic rice prices at IDR 13,004 per kilograms and improving farmers' welfare. Conversely, the 0.8 scenario highlights heavy import dependence, with domestic production plummeting to 2,441,428 tons, exposing the sector to global price volatility and undermining the competitiveness of local farmers. The findings underscore the critical need for agricultural land-use diversification into high-value crops, the establishment of equitable regulatory frameworks, and incentives to sustain farmers' productivity. An optimized communication model is proposed to foster collaboration among key supply chain stakeholders—government agencies, BULOG, farmers, intermediaries, and distributors—through accessible digital tools such as dashboards and mobile applications. This approach improves policy transparency, strengthens distribution networks, and promotes price stability, contributing to a more sustainable regional food system. This research provides a strategic framework for integrating import policy, domestic production strategies, and commodity diversification to bolster food security in East Java. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic systems; Food security; Import policy; Rice supply chain; Supply chain communication","","","","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests.

Digitalisation in the Islamic finance sector plays a strategic role in expanding access to financial inclusion and facilitating more effective community involvement in sharia-based economic activities. Using the robust least squares (RLS) method, this study utilises secondary data for the period 2018-2023 to evaluate the impact of Islamic crowdfunding and e-wakaf on the growth of Islamic fintech. The results show that Islamic crowdfunding significantly expands access to alternative funding, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), while e-wakaf improves transparency and efficiency of waqf asset management through digital technology. These two instruments simultaneously contribute positively to the strengthening of the Islamic fintech ecosystem in Indonesia, creating a strong foundation for broader and sustainable financial inclusion. The findings provide important perspectives for the development of innovative policies and strategies in advancing the Islamic financial sector in the digital era. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digitalisation of Islamic Finance; e-Wakaf; Industrial Revolution 5.0; Islamic Crowdfunding; Islamic Fintech","","","","","Journal of Islamic Finance, (2023); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2023); International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, (2023); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2021); Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, (2024); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2023); Laporan Kajian Ekonomi Dan Keuangan Syariah, (2023); Journal of Statistical Research, (2024); Journal of Islamic Finance Technology, (2023); Essentials of Econometrics, (1992)","","Econjournals","","","","","","21464138","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219038405"

The growth of Fintech is driven by advanced technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI, and robo-advisors, while also posing challenges for regulators and market participants. Fintech research is essential for driving innovation, shaping the future of finance, and addressing emerging challenges. This study examines the awareness and knowledge of Fintech concepts among female university students in Somalia. Using a quantitative cross-sectional research design, 92 students from four universities were surveyed to assess their familiarity with key Fintech topics, including blockchain, smart contracts, neo-banking, and cloud computing. The findings reveal significant gaps in Fintech literacy, with a majority of students showing limited awareness of emerging technologies. While 63% of students expressed the need for a dedicated Fintech course, only 32.6% felt adequately prepared for the Fintech industry. Regression analysis indicated that a student’s major significantly influences their Fintech knowledge.

Using a quantitative approach, the study surveyed 350 stakeholders in Saudi Arabia’s Islamic finance sector, including corporate managers, investment professionals, and financial analysts, over a six-month period (May to October 2024). The findings indicate that stakeholders perceive a positive relationship between ESG disclosures and financial performance, particularly when companies align their ESG practices with Islamic finance principles. However, the study does not measure actual financial performance; rather, it assesses stakeholders’ perceptions of ESG’s influence on corporate governance, risk management, and investment attractiveness. Results suggest that companies integrating ESG principles with Maqasid al-Shariah foster greater stakeholder trust, enhance corporate responsibility, and promote long-term sustainability. However, variations in trust and investment decisions exist based on industry type, ESG disclosure levels, and demographic factors such as experience and familiarity with ESG practices. The study provides novel insights into how Islamic finance principles shape ESG disclosure practices, offering practical recommendations for improving corporate governance and sustainability. By emphasizing transparency, ethical investment, and regulatory alignment, these findings contribute to ongoing discussions on sustainable finance and the role of ESG in shaping Islamic financial institutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ESG disclosure; financial performance; Islamic finance; Saudi Stock Exchange; Shariah compliance; sustainability","financial market; financial services; Islamism; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; stock market; sustainability; Saudi Arabia","","","","Gutiérrez-Ponce, Herenia, Do Sustainability Activities Affect the Financial Performance of Banks?

We review the literature on crypto-asset estate planning and explore lessons from Islamic finance regarding crypto assets. We then use quantitative analysis to compare price-volume relationships in Islamicoin and Bitcoin. To strengthen our analysis, we employ the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate, parametric survival analysis, and the Probit model. Our findings show that Islamicoin's trade volume predicts market price changes more often than Bitcoin's, which seems to be influenced by factors other than trade volume. Further investigation reveals that securities regulators are increasingly enforcing rules against crypto-trading violations. These violations typically occur when trading activity decreases while prices increase. We also find that widespread price changes tend to motivate people to violate the regulations over time. Recently, positive price changes, rather than trade volume, have been the main factor influencing regulatory violations. However, trade effects were observed later in some of our models. Given these findings, we conclude that regulators need to improve digital assets Act to address estate planning issues, in addition to protecting investors.

Through regression analysis, we identify several factors—such as article length, age, position in the issue (lead article status), regional author affiliation, title characteristics (length and novelty), and the presence of multiple authors, keywords, figures, and tables—as significant determinants of citation rates. Furthermore, STM reveals ten dominant themes in BIR, highlighting key focus areas, such as firm dynamics, market and country growth, financial health, and stock market returns.

This study examined the relationship between the banking development score in the dual banking system model and economic growth in Indonesia. This study used a quantitative method, using the VECM approach and the Granger Causality model. The findings showed that Conventional Banking Credit Growth, Sharia Banking Financing Growth, PMTB, LDR and FDR, and ROA of conventional and Sharia banks had a positive effect on economic growth in Indonesia. The inflation variables, NPF, and NPL had a negative effect on economic growth in Indonesia. This finding provided us with an understanding that the existence of Sharia banking could drive economic growth in Indonesia. In conventional banks, in the long term, there was a long-term relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables. This study provided new insights into the influence of the banking sector on economic growth in Indonesia, highlighting the importance of synergy between conventional and Islamic banking in creating diverse financial instruments and enhancing access to banking services, especially in areas with limited financial access. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conventional Banking; Granger Causality; Sharia Banking; VECM","","","","","Zaenurrosyid, A., The Islamic philanthropy model based on maslah } ah } principles for developing Islamic campus in Java, Ijtihad: Jurnal Wacana Hukum Islam dan Kemanusiaan, 24, 2, pp. 279-304, (2024); Abduh, Muhamad, Islamic banking and economic growth: the Indonesian experience, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 5, 1, pp. 35-47, (2012); Abidin, Zainal, Al-Wasathiyah fî al-Iqtishâd al-Islâmî: Ârâ’u ‘ulamâ Jam’iyati “Nahdlatul Ulama” Bi Jawa alSyarqiyah haula “al-Taraddud” bi Sya’ini Fatâwa al-Fawâid al-Mashrîfiyah, Al-Ihkam: Jurnal Hukum dan Pranata Sosial, 18, 1, pp. 246-284, (2023); Anggareni, Erike, Utilizing the Banking System For Digital Waqf Behavioral Approach of Millennial Muslims, El-Usrah, 7, 1, pp. 390-405, (2024); Azizah, Siti Nur, The adoption of FinTech and the legal protection of the digital assets in Islamic/Sharia banking linked with economic development: A case of Indonesia, Journal of World Intellectual Property, 26, 1, pp. 30-40, (2023); Bauer, Michael D., Market-Based Monetary Policy Uncertainty, Economic Journal, 132, 644, pp. 1290-1308, (2022); Bohm, Patrik, Determinants of Financial Literacy: Analysis of the Impact of Family and Socioeconomic Variables on Undergraduate Students in the Slovak Republic, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, 4, (2023); African Development Review, (2000); Dahlan, Ahmad, The Crucial History of Sharia Banking Law Development in Indonesia, Al-Manahij: Jurnal Kajian Hukum Islam, 17, 1, pp. 27-40, (2023); Elvia, Evi Eka, BASYARNAS AS A PLACE FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION OF MUSYARAKAH FINANCING IN SHARIA BANKING IN THE DISRUPTION ERA, El-Mashlahah, 13, 1, pp. 39-56, (2023)","","SCAD Independent","","","","","","24432067; 23388617","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217489834"

However, fragmented management, limited public understanding of productive waqf, and a lack of digital integration hinder the optimization of their synergy. This research explores the integration of zakat and waqf to support Indonesia's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly within local communities. Using a qualitative literature review approach, the study analyzes the potential, challenges, and opportunities of zakat and waqf integration through thematic analysis of secondary data from academic articles, institutional reports, and legal documents. The findings indicate that zakat and waqf can meet urgent needs, such as food security and health services, while also funding long-term projects like education and agriculture. However, fragmented governmental management, poor public awareness of productive waqf, and inadequate digital integration hinder their full potential. Digital technology plays a transformative role by enhancing transparency, fostering community participation, and improving the integration of zakat and waqf management. This synergy represents a promising strategy to advance the SDGs in Indonesia. Further empirical studies and technological advancements are recommended to optimize this collaboration and ensure its impact on sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital; Policy; Sustainable Development Goals; Synergies; Wakaf; Zakat","","","","","Aderemi, Abdulmajeed Muhammad Raji, Qard Hasan as a feasible Islamic financial instrument for crowdfunding: its potential and possible application for financing micro-enterprises in Malaysia, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 15, 1, pp. 58-76, (2023); Alaeddin, Omar, Implementing the Blockchain Technology in Islamic Financial Industry: Opportunities and Challenges, Journal of Information Technology Management, 13, 3, pp. 99-115, (2021); Aliyu, Sirajo, An analysis of crypto-asset trade, enforcement, and estate planning, Borsa Istanbul Review, 25, 1, pp. 206-226, (2025); Ziswaf Jurnal Zakat Dan Wakaf, (2021); Alshaleel, Mohammed Khair, Islamic finance, sustainable development and developing countries: Linkages and potential, pp. 281-305, (2019); J Alif Jurnal Penelitian Hukum Ekonomi Syariah Dan Budaya Islam, (2023); Azrai Azaimi Ambrose, Azniza Hartini, A proposed model for waqf financing public goods and mixed public goods in Malaysia, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 11, 3, pp. 395-415, (2018); International Journal of Trade Economics and Finance, (2013); Ascarya, Ascarya, Developing cash waqf models for Baitul Maal wat Tamwil as integrated Islamic social and commercial microfinance, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 14, 5, pp. 699-717, (2023); Islamic Economic Studies, (2021)","","Lembaga Contrarius Indonesia","","","","","","29878063; 29878071","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002775700"

The primary purpose is to explore blockchain’s potential to address financial risks and inefficiencies while ensuring compliance with Islamic values. Islamic financial institutions face challenges maintaining transaction security and transparency under Sharia constraints, especially as risks like fraud, manipulation, and operational inefficiencies persist. Blockchain’s decentralised ledger system offers solutions by ensuring immutable transaction records, real-time transparency, and secure cryptographic frameworks. Smart contracts further automate Sharia-compliant processes, reducing risks of non-compliance and fraud, while operational efficiencies are achieved through reduced costs and faster transaction processing. However, implementing blockchain in Sharia financial institutions faces limitations, including a lack of technical expertise, regulatory clarity, and inadequate infrastructure in many regions. These barriers highlight the need for capacity-building initiatives and robust regulations to support blockchain adoption in Islamic finance. The study emphasises blockchain’s transformative potential to revolutionise Islamic finance, fostering trust and operational excellence while overcoming current barriers through collaborative efforts.

Based on qualitative interviews, findings reveal that lenders exhibit a positive attitude toward P2P lending, driven by opportunistic investment decisions, the perception of relatively low-risk investments, and the availability of disposable income. This attitude is further reinforced by the accessibility of investment-related information on digital platforms. Beyond individual motivations, social influence plays a crucial role, as family members and digital influencers significantly impact lenders' investment choices. Additionally, perceived behavioral control in digital investment environments is shaped not only by regulatory structures and platform transparency but also by decentralized information sources, investment flexibility, and experiential learning. These findings emphasize the transformative role of digital finance in shaping investor autonomy and risk perception.

Empirical findings reveal varying levels of total connectedness among DeFi assets, sukuk markets, and Islamic equity indexes across different time spans, indicating a moderate but fluctuating degree of integration. DeFi assets generally appear disconnected from sukuk and Islamic stock markets over various periods, with the notable exception of a strong and consistent link between SNX in the DeFi sector and sukuk markets (excluding the Indonesian market) over medium- and long-term durations, suggesting that both DeFi and Islamic assets have hedging capabilities. Additionally, the integration between DeFi and Islamic assets is weaker during the COVID-19 era compared to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict period, with changes in the transmission mechanism.

This study uniquely conducts a bibliometric analysis of the 100 most-cited journal articles on Halal supply chain management based on data retrieved from Scopus (2008–2023). The study involved VOSviewer and Harzing's publish or perish as the main tools for data analysis. A total of 100 journal articles and reviews were analysed using keyword co-occurrence analysis and bibliographic coupling to identify several themes within the context of Halal supply chain management. The keyword co-occurrence analysis produced six themes, including “consumer behaviour and the application of blockchain in Halal supply chain”, “bibliometric analysis and literature review in the Halal food supply chain”, and “Islam and Halal logistics in Malaysia”. While bibliographic coupling produced seven themes, such as “food integrity and blockchain in Halal supply chain management”, and “the analysis of Halal logistics and supply chains on aspects such as adoption of Halal logistics, challenges and opportunities, service quality, and consumer behaviour”. Despite its limitations, the study highlights the novel insights and knowledge gaps on aspects linked to Halal supply chain management.

This cluster provides crucial theme that address aspects of sustainability, risks and barriers towards Halal supply chains. This is relevant, as almost all parts of the world have supply chains that are vulnerable to numerous risks that need to be addressed for the players and chains to remain efficient. Haleem et al. (2021) establishes that Halal products in India with Halal labels are perceived to be crucial for customers involved in Halal supply chains. The study emphasizes the embedding of sustainability in Halal supply chains, highlighting the importance of balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects. This balance is crucial for maintaining integrity and ensuring Halal assurance. Regarding risk assessment, Khan et al. (2021a, 2021b) present risks that affect Halal supply chains in different facets such as production, planning, logistics and outsourcing. These studies call for more efforts toward effective management of identified Halal supply chain risks. Therefore, customers and businesses in Halal supply chains also encounter some risks that they should consider for proper decision making. It has been reported that supply-related risks are the most common that affect Halal food supply chains. On the other hand, the cluster includes studies on aspects of barriers towards Halal supply chains. Understanding these barriers is crucial for effectively addressing challenges and optimizing operations in this specialized sector. Khan, Khan, and Haleem (2022) point out several barriers in Halal SCM which include diminishing demand for Halal products, inadequate laws regulating the Halal industry and the absence of a policy framework. These barriers are regarded as main obstacles that hinder the efficient Halal SCM. Furthermore, Khan et al. (2019) identify barriers to Halal certification, which include inadequate support from the top management, lack of consumer awareness, and an inadequate number of Halal certifying professionals, among others.

With the growing reliance on digital banking and cloud technologies, understanding how e-learning can enhance the effectiveness of these services and improve consumer perception is crucial. The research focuses on examining these variables in the context of Islamic banking, where service quality is often directly linked to customer satisfaction and competitive advantage. Method: to achieve the study’s goal, data was collected from e-banking consumers using a structured survey. The researchers applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS software to analyze the relationships between cloud services, service quality, and competitive service quality, while also examining the moderating role of consumer e-learning. The data sample was obtained from banking consumers in a single country, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Results: the results of the study indicated that: Cloud services have a significant positive impact on competitive service quality, Service quality has a significant positive impact on competitive service quality, the study’s primary contribution was the confirmation of the moderating effect of consumer e-learning. E-learning in the context of consumer education was found to enhance the relationship between cloud services, service quality, and competitive service quality, making it a key factor for improving customer experiences. Conclusions: the study underscores the importance of consumer e-learning in enhancing the quality and competitiveness of cloud services in Islamic banks. However, certain limitations exist, such as the small sample size and the study being confined to only one country. To build on these findings, future research is recommended to include a larger sample size from diverse geographical regions and consider conducting longitudinal studies to assess the pre-and post-learning effects of consumer education on service quality and competitiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud Services; Competitive Service Quality; Islamic Banks; Jordan; Service Quality","Banking; Competition; Customer satisfaction; E-learning; Engineering education; Cloud services; Competitive service quality; Competitive services; Consumer education; E - learning; Islamic bank; Jordan; Quality services; Service Quality; Quality of service","","","","Abedifar, Pejman, Heterogeneous market structure and systemic risk: Evidence from dual banking systems, Journal of Financial Stability, 33, pp. 96-119, (2017); Abror, Abror, Service quality, religiosity, customer satisfaction, customer engagement and Islamic bank’s customer loyalty, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 11, 6, pp. 1691-1705, (2020); Land and Architecture, (2025); Abdallah Alalwan, Ali Abdallah, Examining factors influencing Jordanian customers’ intentions and adoption of internet banking: Extending UTAUT2 with risk, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 40, pp. 125-138, (2018); Environmental Research and Ecotoxicity, (2024); Alenezi, Abdullah Khretan, The role of e-learning materials in enhancing teaching and learning behaviors, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 1, pp. 48-56, (2020); Alghadi, Mohammad Yousef, The influence of some fintech service on the performance of Islamic bank in Jordan, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 8, 1, pp. 393-400, (2024); International Journals of Academic Research World, (2024); Hamada, Abbas Saad, Operating cash flow, corporate governance, and sustainable dividend payouts, International Journal of Entrepreneurship, 22, 4 Specialissue, (2018); Almasarweh, Mohammad Salameh, The impacts of task technology fit, transparency, and supply chain agility on the blockchain adoption by SMEs in Jordan, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 3, pp. 1303-1310, (2023)","","AG Editor (Argentina)","","","","","","29534917","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018042767"

Despite the country’s tremendous technical improvements, use of internet banking remains low. A questionnaire study was conducted with 384 genuine internet banking customers in Saudi Arabia. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed the variables’ underlying structure, whereas confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 22 confirmed reliability and validity. Structural equation modelling (SEM) in AMOS 22 was used to examine 22 hypotheses. According to the findings, perceived utility, perceived simplicity of use, convenience, and website design all had a favourable effect on trust and satisfaction, which in turn promoted online banking uptake. However, security had no meaningful effect on trust or satisfaction. The mediation study found that trust and contentment had a role in mediating the association between perceived utility, perceived ease of use, convenience, and website design and online banking uptake. Surprisingly, neither trust nor contentment mediated the association between security and adoption. The study model explained 62% of the variation in online banking usage. These results help us understand the critical roles of trust and happiness in online banking adoption in Saudi Arabia, and they provide significant insights for the banking industry to enhance consumer adoption strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Online Banking Adoption; Perceived Ease of Use; Satisfaction; Saudi Arabia; Security; Trust","","","","","Abdennebi, Hela Ben, M-banking adoption from the developing countries perspective: A mediated model, Digital Business, 3, 2, (2023); Abdul Sathar, Meharaj Banu, A moderated-mediation model of perceived enjoyment, security and trust on customer satisfaction: evidence from banking industry in India, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 17, 3, pp. 656-679, (2023); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., Customer attitudes towards online shopping: A systematic review of the influencing factors, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 1, pp. 513-524, (2023); Bani Ahmad, Ahmad Y.A., Assessment of Blockchain-Based Accounting Technology on Accounting Report Efficiency Among Business Operators in Jordan, Technical and Vocational Education and Training, 39, pp. 141-151, (2024); Ahmad, Iftikhar Ali, Guardians of the vault: unmasking online threats and fortifying e-banking security, a systematic review, Journal of Financial Crime, 31, 6, pp. 1485-1501, (2024); Impact of Customer Loyalty on Organizational Performance in Some Selected Publishing Companies in South Western Nigeria, (2024); Akhter, Ayeasha, Determining factors of intention to adopt internet banking services: A study on commercial bank users in Bangladesh, Banks and Bank Systems, 17, 1, pp. 125-136, (2022); Alarifi, Areej Abdulrahman, The influence of Internet banking services quality on e-customers’ satisfaction of Saudi banks: comparison study before and during COVID-19, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 40, 2, pp. 496-516, (2023); Sanaa University Journal of Applied Sciences and Technology, (2024); Albarq, Abbas N., The emergence of mobile payment acceptance in Saudi Arabia: the role of reimbursement condition, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 15, 6, pp. 1632-1650, (2024)","","Econjournals","","","","","","21464405","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014280632"

The takaful market is currently facing low penetration due to several challenges, including regulatory compliance, payment efficiency, fraud prevention, and transparency. Blockchain technology, a decentralised, transparent and trust-based system, could address these issues efficiently and effectively by offering smart contracts. This paper examines the feasibility of Blockchain and its impact on Pakistan’s insurance market, in general, and the takaful sector, in particular, using a systematic literature review (SLR) and case studies from Malaysia, the UAE, and Indonesia. In Malaysia and the UAE, the success of using Blockchain in Islamic finance highlights potential efficiency and security benefits. However, in Pakistan's regulatory ambiguity, lack of Shariah-compliant frameworks, limited human expertise, and low industry readiness are a few factors that need to be addressed by the Government of Pakistan. This could lead to sustainable growth in Pakistan’s digital financial sector, including the takaful industry. Policymakers, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the State Bank of Pakistan could benefit from this study by establishing a regulatory sandbox and providing current takaful operators with comprehensive IT and regulatory support to develop Shariah-compliant smart contracts. The results reveal that Takaful operators should develop and test pilot digital projects focusing on cost reduction, fraud prevention, and the automation of standard claims where possible.

Regulatory fragmentation among member states, along with limited oversight, hampers the effective enforcement of core Sharia prohibitions such as riba (usury), gharar (uncertainty), and non-transparent transactions in digital commerce. This inconsistency risks undermining consumer trust and hindering the growth of Islamic digital markets across the region. This study explores the incorporation of Sharia principles into e-commerce regulations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore through a qualitative comparative policy analysis, document review, and expert interviews. Findings indicate that Malaysia and Brunei have developed more mature regulatory frameworks that explicitly embed Sharia norms, whereas Indonesia and Singapore encounter structural and technical barriers to similar integration. Moreover, emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts show promise in enhancing transparency and facilitating Sharia compliance. This article contributes to the discourse by recommending the establishment of an ASEAN-level coordinating body to harmonize Sharia-compliant e-commerce regulations and develop adaptable guidelines for member states. Such an institutional approach is vital for fostering regulatory coherence, enhancing market confidence, and supporting the sustainable development of Islamic digital finance. Future research should focus on leveraging advanced digital technologies to operationalize Sharia compliance across ASEAN’s digital economy.Perkembangan pesat e-commerce di ASEAN menawarkan potensi ekonomi yang besar namun juga menghadirkan tantangan mendesak dalam mengintegrasikan prinsip-prinsip Syariah ke dalam kerangka regulasi. Fragmentasi regulasi antarnegara anggota, disertai dengan pengawasan yang terbatas, menghambat penegakan efektif larangan-larangan utama Syariah seperti riba (bunga), gharar (ketidakpastian), dan transaksi yang tidak transparan dalam perdagangan digital. Ketidakkonsistenan regulasi ini berisiko merusak kepercayaan konsumen dan pertumbuhan pasar digital Islam di kawasan tersebut. Penelitian ini mengkaji sejauh mana prinsip Syariah telah diintegrasikan dalam regulasi e-commerce di Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, dan Singapura melalui analisis kebijakan komparatif kualitatif, tinjauan dokumen, dan wawancara ahli. Hasil menunjukkan bahwa Malaysia dan Brunei telah mengembangkan kerangka regulasi yang lebih matang dengan secara eksplisit memasukkan norma-norma Syariah, sementara Indonesia dan Singapura menghadapi hambatan struktural dan teknis dalam integrasi serupa. Selain itu, teknologi baru seperti blockchain dan smart contract menunjukkan potensi besar dalam meningkatkan transparansi dan memfasilitasi kepatuhan Syariah. Artikel ini memberikan kontribusi dengan merekomendasikan pembentukan lembaga koordinasi tingkat ASEAN untuk menyelaraskan regulasi e-commerce yang sesuai Syariah serta mengeluarkan pedoman yang dapat disesuaikan bagi negara anggota. Pendekatan kelembagaan ini sangat penting untuk mendorong konsistensi regulasi, meningkatkan kepercayaan pasar, dan mendukung pengembangan berkelanjutan keuangan digital Islam. Penelitian lanjutan disarankan fokus pada pemanfaatan teknologi digital maju untuk mengoperasionalkan kepatuhan Syariah di ekonomi digital ASEAN. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ASEAN; e-commerce; sharia principles","","","","","Azmi, Ilhaamie Abdul Ghani, Islamic Business in Malaysia: Scenario and Challenges, Contributions to Management Science, Part F3298, pp. 201-218, (2024); Abozaid, Abdulazeem Jalal, Revisiting Riba & Gharar in Light of a Contemporary Analysis of Their Shariah Objectives, Eurasian Studies in Business and Economics, 27, pp. 333-348, (2024); Aji, Nadia Syahirah, Readiness of digital transformation in the private sector: Brunei's case study, pp. 116-142, (2023); Ayedh, Abdullah Mohammed, The integration of Shariah compliance in information system of Islamic financial institutions: Qualitative evidence of Malaysia, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 13, 1, pp. 37-49, (2019); Batubara, Chuzaimah, Realizing Justice and Maṣlaḥah in E-Commerce: Fiqh Muamalah Insights and Challenges in Malaysia and Indonesia, Juris: Jurnal Ilmiah Syariah, 23, 2, pp. 253-267, (2024); Farliana, Nina, Sustainability of the Digital Economy in Indonesia: Opportunities, Challenges and Future Development, Review of Business and Economics Studies, 11, 4, pp. 21-28, (2023); Gorian, Ella, Singapore’s cybersecurity act 2018: A new generation standard for critical information infrastructure protection, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 138, pp. 1-9, (2020); Hamsin, Muhammad Khaeruddin, Addressing Cybercrime in the Sharia Digital Wallet Industry: A Legal Perspective in the Indonesian Context, E3S Web of Conferences, 440, (2023); Hamsin, Muhammad Khaeruddin, Sharia E-Wallet: The Issue of Sharia Compliance and Data Protection, Al-Manahij: Jurnal Kajian Hukum Islam, 17, 1, pp. 53-68, (2023); Heikal, M., Digitalization of Halal Food Supply Chain Management Based on Blockchain Technology, Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics, pp. 103-121, (2024)","","Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang","","","","","","20867549; 25283383","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011053071"

Nevertheless, the industry faces challenges in achieving operational efficiency, ensuring transparency, and promoting financial inclusion. Industry 4.0 (IR4.0) technologies—namely Blockhain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT)—offer innovative solutions to address these issues. These technologies optimise resource utilisation, enhance operational transpacrency, and foster customer trust by ensuring compliance with Halal and ethical standards. This study underscores the importance of integrating IR4.0 technologies into the Halal industry with Islamic Monetary Economics (IME) principles, particularly in promoting financial inclusion, ethical procurement, and sustainability. Employing the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework, this study integrates Economic Sustainability (Financial Inclusion), Social Equity (Maslahah), and Environmental Stewardship (Tayyib) into a comprehensive model that connects IR4.0 technologies with the maqasid al-Shariah. By prioritising the preservation of faith, life, intellect, progeny, and wealth, this model positions the Halal industry as a global leader in ethical and sustainable economic development. This study employs a qualitative research design, appropriate for addressing the selected research topics and issues. The findings highlight the urgent need for stakeholders—businesses, regulators, and consumers—to embrace technological innovations and adapt to the evolving global commerce landscape. By taking proactive measures, stakeholders can harness IR4.0’s potential to shape a prosperous and inclusive future for the Halal industry and its communities. Ultimately, this study emphasises the sector’s potential to drive economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability, shaping a more inclusive and prosperous future for the communities it serves. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Halal industry; IR4.0 technologies; Islamic monetary economics; sustainability","","","","This study is funded by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) of Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/SS02/USIM/ 02/2).","Rejeb, Abderahman, Halal food supply chains: A literature review of sustainable measures and future research directions, Foods and Raw Materials, 9, 1, pp. 106-116, (2021); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); Journal of Islamic Marketing, (2023); Sustainability, (2020); International Journal of Islamic Business Ethics, (2020); Journal of Islamic, (2019); Barbosa, Marcelo Werneck, Managing supply chain resources with Big Data Analytics: a systematic review, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 21, 3, pp. 177-200, (2018); Billah, Arif, Factors influencing Muslim and non-Muslim consumers’ consumption behavior: A case study on halal food, Journal of Foodservice Business Research, 23, 4, pp. 324-349, (2020); Afr J Sociol Psychol Stud, (2022); International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Arts, (2023)","","Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","","","","","","25904396; 19857454","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006730440"

Within the framework of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, which encompasses approximately 72 countries—nearly half of which are predominantly Muslim—it is essential to recognize the significance of product integrity and authenticity. Given the substantial market potential in these regions, stakeholders must focus on meeting the demand for nutritional halal foods. This approach not only satisfies consumers’ religious requirements but also fosters trust and loyalty within this diverse demographic. An online survey consisting of two segments was conducted, and responses were analyzed using STATA version 16. The survey was disseminated through email, Facebook, and WhatsApp, resulting in a total of 435 responses, of which 399 were deemed complete and suitable for analysis. In the second segment, 279 respondents were evaluated, comprising 18 producers, 33 intermediaries, 70 wholesalers, and 158 retailers, to assess the growing market demand for nutritional halal foods and understand prevailing business trends. The results reveal that a 1-unit increase in the availability of product video links leads to a 63.4% increase in customer demand, while a 1-unit increase in customer belief and satisfaction results in increases of 23.3 and 5% in demand, respectively, highlighting the importance of transparency, religious compliance, and consumer trust in driving demand for halal products. The initial analysis of consumer behavior in OBOR Muslim countries, followed by a thorough examination of producers, intermediaries, wholesalers, and retailers, provides valuable insights into the projected growth in demand for Halal food. With an estimated 1.9 billion Muslims constituting approximately 25.01% of the global population—and 92% residing in OBOR nations—it is evident that halal dietary principles transcend national boundaries. By implementing strategic policies, stakeholders, including policymakers and firm managers, can optimize their efforts to meet the nutritional demands of this expansive market. Furthermore, this study identifies the need for additional exploration into related aspects such as sustainable traceability of quality halal products, brand image clarity, and consumer awareness of supply chain operations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","food quality certification; halal food demand; intelligent manufacturing; OBOR; sustainable marketing strategy","","","","","Bradley, Peter, An Institutional Economics Framework to Explore Sustainable Production and Consumption, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 1317-1339, (2021); Mohsin, Muhammad, How external debt led to economic growth in South Asia: A policy perspective analysis from quantile regression, Economic Analysis and Policy, 72, pp. 423-437, (2021); Zailani, Suhaiza Hanim Binti Dato Mohamad, Drivers of halal orientation strategy among halal food firms, British Food Journal, 117, 8, pp. 2143-2160, (2015); Asioli, Daniele, Do consumers value food products containing upcycled ingredients?

However, they also pose significant challenges to long-term sustainability. While the existing literature provides valuable insights into their influence, a broader scope is necessary to reflect their role in advancing sustainable finance. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of 2,446 publications from the Web of Science (1996–2024) to map the evolving nexus between emerging technologies and finance. Our findings reveal an expanding research landscape, with key themes including the application of emerging technologies in solving financial problems, the integration of technologies with behavioural and regulatory frameworks, financial innovation for promoting development, risk management and financial stability, digital currencies and blockchain, digital transformation challenges, and sustainable finance. The analysis highlights the dual nature of emerging technologies: while they enhance financial efficiency, transparency, and inclusion, and offer significant opportunities to advance sustainable finance, they also introduce risks such as cybersecurity threats, algorithmic bias, regulatory challenges, and critical barriers to long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, we propose a research agenda prioritizing ethical governance, stress-testing AI models under economic crises, securing decentralized systems, mitigating greenwashing risks, and fostering globally aligned regulatory standards. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to tackle ethical, security, and inclusivity concerns. It is imperative for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions to align technological innovation with sustainability objectives to ensure that advancements contribute to the development of an equitable, resilient, and inclusive financial ecosystem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; bibliometric analysis; Business, Management and Accounting; Economics; Emerging technologies; Finance; fintech; sustainable finance","","","","","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Quantile price convergence and spillover effects among Bitcoin, Fintech, and artificial intelligence stocks, International Review of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-205, (2023); Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Blockchain market and eco-friendly financial assets: Dynamic price correlation, connectedness and spillovers with portfolio implications, International Review of Economics and Finance, 87, pp. 218-243, (2023); Gsc Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Asia Pacific Management Accounting Journal, (2021); Aboelfotoh, Ahmed, Examining the ability of big data analytics to investigate financial reporting quality: a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 23, 2, pp. 444-471, (2025); Abramo, Giovanni, The suitability of h and g indexes for measuring the research performance of institutions, Scientometrics, 97, 3, pp. 555-570, (2013); Abramo, Giovanni, Citations versus journal impact factor as proxy of quality: Could the latter ever be preferable?, Scientometrics, 84, 3, pp. 821-833, (2010); Abu Afifa, Malik Muneer, Blockchain adoption in accounting by an extended UTAUT model: empirical evidence from an emerging economy, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 21, 1, pp. 5-44, (2023); Acheampong, Albert, Does soft information determine credit risk?

Despite their importance, female entrepreneurs continue to face significant challenges. Previous research has looked into the factors that influence the success of female entrepreneurs, but there are few studies on how these factors interact, especially with digital government support. This study aims to bridge this gap by using total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) to investigate the role of digital government in increasing female entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia. A literature review identified eight critical success factors (CSFs): digital government, family background, entrepreneurial attitude, start-up intent, social networks, self-efficacy, dynamic capabilities, and digital innovation. The study contributes to entrepreneurial self-efficacy, social capital, and institutional theories by incorporating these CSFs into a strategic framework.

After analyzing different chaotic map types, this paper generates a new 1D chaotic system based on sin and logistic maps. After that, we derived a new map with quantum corrections by coupling a kicked quantum system with a harmonic oscillator bath. As the dissipation parameter increases, we observe a period-doubling progression towards classical behavior, along with other intriguing characteristics at intermediate parameter values. Then, this new chaotic system is applied to the Schnorr and Elgamal schemes. Extensive randomness tests were conducted, and the algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance. Following rigorous testing and analysis, the algorithm exhibited impressive signing and verification times of approximately 0.0000799212 (s) and 0.0000100223 (s) for the Schnorr scheme, and 0.000029932 (s) and 0.0000399298 (s) for the Elgamal scheme, respectively. These times are notably lower compared to other proposed algorithms. The private key space was expanded to 2256 from 2160, further strengthening security.

It presents the findings from a systematic review to better explain the pros and cons of utilizing these disruptive technologies for crowdsourcing and/or crowd-investing purposes. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodical protocol to search, screen, extract and scrutinize seventy-two (72) articles that were indexed in both Scopus and Web of Science. They examine their research questions, describe their methodologies. Afterwards, they synthesize the findings from previous literature, outline implications and discuss about future research avenues. Findings: A thorough review of the relevant literature suggests that there are opportunities as well as challenges for project initiators as well as for crowd-investors, if they are considering equity crowdfunding, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and rewards-based crowdfunding platforms, among others, to raise awareness about their projects and to access finance from crowd-investors. Research limitations/implications: Further research is required on this timely topic. There are a number of theories relating to technology adoption and/or innovation management, strategic management, accounting and financial reporting, and normative/business ethics, among other research areas, that can be utilized as theoretical bases, to explore this topic. Practical implications: Crowd-investors are striving in their endeavors to find a trade-off between risks and rewards associated with crowd-financing. Originality/value: Currently, there are few systematic reviews and conceptual articles focused on the crowdfunding of small businesses and startups. Hence this contribution closes this gap in the academic literature. Moreover, it links the extant theory to practice. It clarifies that the resource-based view theory of the firm, the theory of planned behavior, the diffusion of innovations theory as well as the signaling theory, among other conceptual frameworks, can be used to investigate different facets of crowdsourcing and crowd-investing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowd sourcing; Crowd-investing; Crowdfunding; Diffusion of innovations; Resource-based view; Signaling theory","","","","The authors thank the editor, guest editors and their reviewers, for their constructive remarks and suggestions.

However, these banks are required to comply with Sharia principles for their products and services. This study was conducted to analyze the justification of digitalization of Islamic banking system and compliance of the digital services implemented to Sharia principles. It employed doctrinal legal study methods. Data were retrieved from literature references and were analysed qualitatively using a conceptual and statutory approach. The results showed several reasons to justify digitalization of Islamic banking system and these include the current demand for digital products and services, the prevalence of the millennial generation, and the legal backing provided for the advancement in Indonesia. These principles mandate that Islamic banks must avoid practices involving maisir (gambling), gharar (obscurity), haram (prohibited activities), riba (usury), and zalim (injustice).

We use a quantitative method to examine how mandatory risk disclosure (MRD) and voluntary risk disclosure (VRD) impact return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) in Islamic banks operating in Jordan. Our results show that both MRD and VRD have a significant effect on FP of Islamic banks. Moreover, FinTech acts as a moderator in the connection between risk disclosure (MRD and VRD) and FP performance. The effect was compared before and after coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it shows that the COVID-19 has increased the effect of MRD and VRD on FP of Islamic banks.

While these services may be regarded as FinTech, involving cryptocurrency as the major transaction currency has made these services potentially distinctive from other fiat-based FinTech services. Thus, the critical success factors of crypto-exchanges may not be identical to those of other fiat-based FinTech services. Grounded on theories related to FinTech and service varieties, we developed a survey and explored the role of different factors on users’ continuous intention of adopting the crypto-exchanges. Our results suggested that when users perceive specific crypto-exchange characteristics, they are more likely to adopt the exchange continuously. Combining previous literature, we name this set of factors “LAS-VICT principle”, including low user-burden, asset-light, scalability, variety, innovativeness, scalability, and transparency. However, users’ emphasis on factors may differ based on their cryptocurrency experience.

Based on a sample comprising the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 companies from 2016 to 2020, the findings indicate that, although there has been progress in corporate transparency concerning modern slavery, a significant gap persists in the reporting on the measurement and monitoring of the effectiveness of their policies. This may stem from powerful CEOs' desires to maintain a positive corporate image, leading to minimal disclosure of potentially damaging information. The fixed effects panel regression analysis reveals a negative relationship between CEO power (CEOP) and the extent of modern slavery disclosures (MSD), with a significant moderating effect observed when female board representation is substantial. This evidence suggests that female board members may challenge groupthink and introduce diverse perspectives that can alter the board's dynamics, potentially mitigating the negative impact of CEOP on issues like modern slavery disclosure by encouraging more ethical and collective decision-making. This research underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in addressing modern slavery and promoting more responsible business practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","board gender diversity; CEO power; modern slavery disclosures; sustainable development goals; UK","decision making; ethics; gender disparity; slavery; Sustainable Development Goal; United Kingdom","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by The British Academy, which funded this project through the Leverhulme Small Research Grant SRG22\\220712.

The results are as follows: (1) under normal market conditions, in long-run horizons there is a significant positive cross-spectral relationship between FinTech's positive volatilities and Stellar’s negative volatilities; (2) Stellar’s negative and positive volatilities exhibit the highest net spillovers at the lower and upper tails, respectively; and (3) the quantile-based causality results indicate that Bitcoin’s good (bad) volatilities can lead to bad (good) volatilities in all three smart technologies operating between normal and bull market conditions. Moreover, the Bitcoin industry’s negative volatilities have a bilateral cause-and-effect relationship with FinTech’s positive volatilities. By analyzing the second moment, we found that Bitcoin's negative volatilities are the only cause variable that generates FinTech's good volatility in a unidirectional manner. As for Stellar, only bad volatilities have the potential to signal good volatilities for cutting-edge technologies in some middle quantiles, whereas good volatilities have no significant effect. Hence, the trade-off between Bitcoin and cutting-edge technologies, especially FinTech-related advancements, appear more broadly and randomly compared with the Stellar-innovative technologies nexus. The findings provide valuable insights for FinTech companies, blockchain developers, crypto-asset regulators, portfolio managers, and high-tech investors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Financial technology; G17; Non-parametric quantile causality; O14; O32; Q55; Volatilities","","","","","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Quantile price convergence and spillover effects among Bitcoin, Fintech, and artificial intelligence stocks, International Review of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-205, (2023); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, How COVID-19 drives connectedness among commodity and financial markets: Evidence from TVP-VAR and causality-in-quantiles techniques, Resources Policy, 70, (2021); Agarwal, Yashasvi, Delivering high-tech, AI-based health care at Apollo Hospitals, Global Business and Organizational Excellence, 39, 2, pp. 20-30, (2020); Redefining Banking and Financial Industry Through the Application of Computational Intelligence, (2019); Ahluwalia, Saurabh, Blockchain technology and startup financing: A transaction cost economics perspective, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 151, (2020); Regulation of Fintech and Cryptocurrencies Fintech in Islamic Finance, (2019); Money, (2018); Ali, Muhammad Salek, Applications of Blockchains in the Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 2, pp. 1676-1717, (2019); Allen, Franklin, Fintech, Cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial Structural Transformation in China, Journal of International Money and Finance, 124, (2022); Almeida, Dora Maria Fortes, COVID-19 Effects on the Relationship between Cryptocurrencies: Can It Be Contagion?

Our results also display that gold-backed cryptocurrencies act as suitable hedging (or diversifying) assets during normal times. Nevertheless, such assets can be considered as robust safe havens during the 2022 bear market for the most of NFT and DeFi assets. More specifically, PAXG and PMGT are found to be the best safe haven instruments for both NFT and DeFi tokens. DGX also serves as safe-haven assets for some NFT and DeFi assets, but with a lower risk-mitigation capacity compared to PAXG and PMGT. In most cases, DGX tends to act as a strong diversifier. Its hedging feature is only recorded for the NFT Protocol (xNFT) and the DeFi token Chainlink (LINK). Our results are of particular interest to investors and portfolio managers who search for safe havens to mitigate the risk of their NFT and DeFi portfolios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geopolitical event; Gold-backed cryptocurrencies; Health crisis; Hedge; Safe-haven","","","","","Proceedings of the 1st Universitas Kuningan International Conference on Social Science Environment and Technology Uniset 2020 12 December 2020 Kuningan West Java Indonesia, (2020); Finance Res Lett, (2021); Alam, Nafis, Fintech and Islamic finance: Digitalization, development and disruption, pp. 1-178, (2019); Applied Economics and Finance, (2022); Ali, Fahad, An examination of whether gold-backed Islamic cryptocurrencies are safe havens for international Islamic equity markets, Research in International Business and Finance, 63, (2022); Aloui, Chaker, Are Islamic gold-backed cryptocurrencies different?, Finance Research Letters, 39, (2021); Ante, Lennart, The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Market and Its Relationship with Bitcoin and Ethereum, FinTech, 1, 3, pp. 216-224, (2022); Baur, Dirk G., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

The study employed a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model, incorporating perceived security and personal innovativeness as independent variables, and trust as a moderating variable. A total of 391 responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling in SmartPLS software. The study’s findings indicate that factors such as effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived, and personal innovativeness positively affect users’ behavioral intention (BI) to use fintech services in the insurance industry. Moreover, BI positively influences the actual use (AU) of fintech services. Additionally, trust plays a positive moderating role between BI and AU. The results of this study have practical implications for academicians, researchers, insurance companies, and insurance regulatory bodies. Academicians and researchers can further explore the acceptance of fintech in developing countries based on these findings. Insurance companies and regulatory bodies can take necessary steps and formulate strategies to promote the adoption of fintech services in the insurance industry, considering the identified factors and the role of trust. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Effort expectancy; Facilitating conditions; Fintech services; Perceived security; Personal innovativeness; Social influence; Trust","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

The study utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the data collected from a sample of 364 professionals working in the field of Islamic banking. The results of our study suggest that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Social Influence are important factors in predicting individuals' Behavioural Intention to use Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Significantly, it was shown that Use Behaviour played a significant role in determining the perceived quality of financial reporting. Nevertheless, the study did not find empirical evidence to demonstrate the direct influence of Behavioural Intention on Financial Reporting Quality.

The introduction of equity crowdfunding (ECF) has added a new dimension to alternative financing in Malaysia. Since its inception in 2015, ECF has seen widespread adoption, showcasing the pivotal role of ECF platforms in connecting fundraisers with investors, thereby aiding SMEs in securing funding and investors in attaining returns. This study investigated two aspects of financial management, namely financial analysis and reporting and financial planning and control (FPC). Performance was assessed using financial metrics (Model 1) and customer performance (CP) as a non-financial metric (Model 2). Surveys were digitally distributed to 231 respondents, representing issuers who had successfully raised ECF funds from 2016 to 2019. This “authority of the sender” tactic was employed to ensure that the survey reached the appropriate respondents. Ultimately, 92 respondents met the study’s criteria. The research drew on the theory of financial bricolage, utilising statistical tools like SPSS 20.0 and Smart-PLS 3.0. The findings indicated that Models 1 and 2 were compatible only with FPC. However, FPC had a negative impact on the CP metric, possibly due to FPC overlooking other factors that improve customer performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","authority of sender; business intelligence; Equity crowdfunding; online platform","","","","From the study\u2019s initial perspective, key differentiators between SMEs funded by ECF and those that do not include financial innovation, ownership in the investment firm, and reliance on the ECF platform for funding rather than traditional funding institutions.

A total of 258 individuals in Malaysia were asked to complete a questionnaire to gather statistics. To assess the research model and test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling with partial least squares (SEM-PLS) was utilized. Smart PLS path analysis results revealed that perceived convenience, perceived security, perceived cost social influence, and innovativeness were positively significant determinants of digital payment adoption. This study offers fresh theoretical perspectives for identifying potential adoption barriers that need to be addressed. Concerns about privacy and security, a lack of information or comprehension, and aversion to change are all prevalent challenges among Millennials. Recognizing these limitations allows service providers to incorporate measures such as better security features, educational campaigns, and user-friendly interfaces to alleviate these concerns and boost adoption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital payment; Generation Z; innovativeness; mobile payment; perceived convenience; perceived cost; social influence","","","","","Journal of Education Al Mejlh Altrbwyh, (2023); American Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, (2017); Alochana Chakra Journal, (2020); Arab Journal of Administrative Sciences, (2023); Journal of Education Al Mejlh Altrbwyh, (2024); Al-Gasaymeh, Anwar S., Dynamic Model in Estimating the Impact of Competition on Banking Efficiency: Evidence form MENA Countries, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 193, pp. 385-394, (2023); Alghamdi, Hanan M., Unveiling Sentiments: A Comprehensive Analysis of Arabic Hajj-Related Tweets from 2017–2022 Utilizing Advanced AI Models, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 8, 1, (2024); Alghusin, Nawaf Salem, The impact of financial policy on economic growth in Jordan (2000-2017): An ardl approach, Ekonomski Pregled, 71, pp. 97-108, (2020); Alhaimer, Rashed Salem, Digital transformation on the design and implementation of virtual political campaigns in Kuwait: perceptions and attitudes of politicians and campaign managers for bold innovation and social impact in Kuwait, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, (2024); Alhawamdeh, Loai Naser, Do E-Service Quality and Digital Content Moderate the Relationship between Website Design and the Intention to visit the Museum?, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 194, pp. 143-150, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210601131"

Furthermore, the ratification of Law Number 6 of 2023 encourages synergy between BPJPH (Halal Product Guarantee Organizing Agency), LPH (Halal Inspection Agency), and MUI (Indonesian Ulema Council). This phenomenon encourages research on building a culture of awareness of Islamic law toward a prosperous and just country. This research aims to determine the contribution of collaboration between stakeholders in advancing prosperity and justice. It employs the Penta Helix and Circle of Equity theories. It utilizes a legal approach with comparative descriptive analysis. It found that building a culture of awareness of Islamic law to improve prosperity and justice in Indonesia, especially regarding the issue of halal certification, requires synergistic collaboration between the various stakeholders involved. Regarding legal justice, Law Number 6 of 2023 requires an integrated electronic system to implement JPH (Halal Product Guarantee). Through comparative legislative and descriptive approaches with a focus on synergy, it shows that the Penta Helix and Circle of Equity Synergy theories can be an effective way to increase the culture of awareness of Islamic law, especially in the issue of halal certification, by ensuring the consistency of the implementation of Law Nomor 6 in 2023. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Awareness Culture; Halal Certification Services; Halal Product Assurance Organizers; Islamic Laws","","","","","Petita Jurnal Kajian Ilmu Hukum Dan Syariah, (2020); Abdul Halim, Nura Ruhaya, Non-conformance report (NCR) on Malaysia halal certification: A case study among small-medium scale food enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia, Food Control, 160, (2024); Prinsip Prinsip Etika Bisnis Islami Dalam Optimalisasi Potensi Pariwisata Halal Dan Prospek Penerapannya Di Kabupaten Pangandaran, (2023); Al-Ansi, Amr, Role of halal-friendly destination performances, value, satisfaction, and trust in generating destination image and loyalty, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 13, pp. 51-60, (2019); Al Halbusi, Hussam, Ethical leadership, subordinates’ moral identity and self-control: Two- and three-way interaction effect on subordinates’ ethical behavior, Journal of Business Research, 165, (2023); Alam, Md Kausar, Do Islamic banks use institutional theory in the light of Shariah governance?

The study utilized a structured questionnaire to evaluate 231 students’ understanding and familiarity with fintech concepts, focusing on demographic factors and perceived curriculum gaps. The study’s participants were diverse in gender, age, institution, major, and year of study. The majority were male (63%), with 78% aged between 20 and 25. The study reveals that students’ familiarity and understanding of fintech concepts like blockchain, smart contracts, neo-banking, crowdfunding, cloud computing, big data analytics, robo-advisors, and AI are low. This highlights significant gaps in students’ knowledge of critical areas digital finance, e-payments or e-banking. The study shows a moderate correlation between demographic factors and students’ fintech awareness, with 13.9% of variation explained by these factors. The overall model is statistically significant (F = 7.265, P < 0.001), indicating that these factors collectively impact students’ knowledge and awareness of fintech. Gender, age, and university attended do not significantly influence fintech awareness, suggesting they are not major determinants. However, the study reveals that students’ awareness of fintech increases as they progress through their academic years, with certain majors showing higher levels of awareness. The study recommends universities incorporate fintech topics into their courses, develop accessible options, invest in resources, collaborate with fintech companies, strengthen industry partnerships, and offer cross-disciplinary electives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Awareness; Digitalization; Financial Services; Fintech; Internet of Things; Somalia","","","","","Journal of Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation, (2023); Al-Fuqaha, Ala Isam, Internet of Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 17, 4, pp. 2347-2376, (2015); Islamic Banking and Finance Review, (2018); International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, (2021); Alshraifa, Husain, FinTech Education: An Exploratory Study from the Point View of Business Students, Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, 503, pp. 153-169, (2024); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Asian Journal of Economics Business and Accounting, (2022); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Dasilas, Apostolos, The impact of FinTech firms on bank performance: evidence from the UK, EuroMed Journal of Business, 20, 1, pp. 244-258, (2025); Fintech in Germany, (2017)","","Econjournals","","","","","","21464138","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208743237"

Based on a panel dataset of 2785 observations (220 banks) from 16 Sub-Saharan Africa countries between 2007 and 2022, we observe that bank sustainability reporting framework (BSRF) and board sustainability committee (BSCOM) are positively related to increased levels of BCCIs. Second, the study shows that the BSRF-BCCIs and BSCOM-BCCIs associations are positively moderated by CORPGOVDISCIN, indicating that these relationships are contingent on the quality of the bank's corporate governance mechanisms. Third, the study then provides evidence that BSCOM is positively related to FP, but BSRF has no effect on FP. Fourth, we also observe that BCCIs disclosure has positive impact on FP, but actual BCCIs investments do not seem to improve FP. Fifth, the study detects that the association between BCCIs and FP is significantly moderated by CG mechanisms. We identify CG disclosure as the possible channel through which BCCIs and FP are interlinked. Finally, we show that the predicted relationships vary across banks' operating periods.

Nonetheless, the aspect of risk management necessitates further enhancement, as effective risk management is essential for safeguarding the interests of both investors and MSMEs regarding asset protection (hifz al-mal).

This study aims to examine the characteristics of banks in Indonesia that influence lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises by adopting agency theory that explains the relationship between lenders (banks) and borrowers (MSMEs) as agents and principals. Data were taken from quarterly financial reports of banks in Indonesia. There are 42 sample banks from 2010 to 2022, so the data used are 2,182 observations. Data analysis uses a fixed effect model with robust standard errors. The results show that operating costs do not influence credit access for MSMEs or medium-sized enterprises. Bank stability has an impact on increasing MSME credit access. High bank capital also increases MSME credit access. Robustness tests were also conducted using the general method of moments. The results were consistent with the main model. The implication is that cost management theory and credit decision-making need to consider differences in business scale. The results also further strengthen the argument that bank stability is an important factor that can improve access to credit for small and medium enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bank capital; bank cost; bank stability; financial inclusion; lending; MSMEs","","","","Appreciation is given to the Doctoral program Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta Indonesia and the Institute of Research and Community Services (LPPM) Unisnu Jepara Indonesia, which has supported this research.","Abbas, Faisal, The impact of bank capital, bank liquidity and credit risk on profitability in postcrisis period:‎ A comparative study of US and Asia, Cogent Economics and Finance, 7, 1, (2019); Adhikary, Bishnu Kumar, Does the government credit guarantee promote micro, small, and medium enterprises?

Employing a normative legal approach and a descriptive-analytical method, the research examines legal principles and facts concerning cryptocurrency regulation in Indonesia. The findings reveal that, despite the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, their usage remains contentious from both regulatory and Islamic law perspectives. In Islamic law, cryptocurrency transactions are classified as haram lighairihi due to uncertainty (gharar) and speculative risks, making them non-compliant with Sharia principles. As a solution, this study proposes a framework for integrating cryptocurrency exchanges with Rupiah transactions using Sharia economic principles.

The findings reveal that both service quality and product attributes significantly influence customer satisfaction, with service quality demonstrating a stronger correlation. Notably, aspects such as employee friendliness, responsiveness, and product diversity emerged as critical factors. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the importance of service quality in enhancing customer satisfaction specifically in the Islamic banking sector, an area that has received limited attention. The implications of this study are twofold: first, it offers valuable insights for Islamic banking institutions to refine their service delivery and product offerings, thereby fostering greater customer loyalty. Second, it highlights the need for continuous assessment of customer expectations and satisfaction metrics to ensure sustainable growth in the competitive financial landscape.

Whilst this type of technology is seen as a step forward in terms of traceability, transparency and immutability to increase digital resilience, we argue that it should be approached with trepidation. Design/methodology/approach: In developing this paper, the authors conduct a systematic literature search using the Scopus database. Through this, we identified 931 relevant articles, of which 30 were used as the focus of this article. Thematic analysis was used as the analytical approach to develop themes and meaning from the data. Findings: In this paper, there is an emphasis on the importance of understanding the potential risks associated with SC implementation, as well as identifying appropriate strategies for mitigating any negative impact. In our findings, we puts forward three key themes, namely legality, security and human error, which we argue are key smart contract challenges that impact SME digital resilience. Originality/value: In this paper, we propose the notion of “centralised control in decentralised solutions”. This comes from the research highlighting SC weaknesses in digital resilience for SMEs. We argue that there is a need for standards, regulations and legislation to address these issues, advocating, ironically, a centralised approach to decentralised technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Digital resilience; International entrepreneurship; Smart contracts; SMEs","","","","","Kumar Agrawal, Tarun Kumar, Blockchain-based framework for supply chain traceability: A case example of textile and clothing industry, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 154, (2021); Kumar Agrawal, Tarun Kumar, Demonstration of a blockchain-based framework using smart contracts for supply chain collaboration, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 5, pp. 1497-1516, (2023); Albizri, Abdullah, Trust but verify: The oracle paradox of blockchain smart contracts, Journal of Information Systems, 35, 2, pp. 1-16, (2021); Alexander, Carol O., Price discovery and microstructure in ether spot and derivative markets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 71, (2020); Mastering Ethereum Building Smart Contracts and Dapps, (2018); Arslan, Ahmad, Artificial intelligence and human workers interaction at team level: a conceptual assessment of the challenges and potential HRM strategies, International Journal of Manpower, 43, 1, pp. 75-88, (2022); Asadi, Mandana, The appropriation of blockchain implementation in the supply chain of SMES based on fuzzy LMAW, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 123, (2023); Asante Boakye, Elijah, Seizing technological advancement; determinants of blockchain supply chain finance adoption in Ghanaian SMEs, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 36, 10, pp. 2774-2790, (2024); Asante, Mary, Distributed Ledger Technologies in Supply Chain Security Management: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 2, pp. 713-739, (2023); Badi, Sulafa M., Technological, organisational and environmental determinants of smart contracts adoption: UK construction sector viewpoint, Construction Management and Economics, 39, 1, pp. 36-54, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17410398","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186439930"

Successful integration of asset transfers across diverse DeFi platforms hinges on effective interoperability and transaction finality, ensuring security and cost efficiency. This paper introduces CrossDeFi, a novel cross-chain communication protocol tailored to address the challenges posed by heterogeneity in consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and token systems. CrossDeFi introduces two key mechanisms: Miner and bridge selection (MBS) and improved transfer confirmation (ITC). The MBS mechanism optimizes the selection of miners and bridges based on the unique characteristics of each blockchain, significantly improving transfer accuracy, cost efficiency, and speed. Meanwhile, the ITC mechanism leverages cryptographic primitives to secure asset transfer confirmations, ensuring robust transaction finality. The protocol’s effectiveness is demonstrated through detailed efficiency and security analyses, complemented by a prototype evaluation that showcases its capabilities in reducing transfer durations and costs. These findings underscore the potential of CrossDeFi to transform the DeFi ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain interoperability; cross-chain asset transfer; CrossDeFi protocol; DeFi (decentralized finance); finality guarantee in the blockchain; smart contract security","Blockchain; Block-chain; Blockchain interoperability; Communications protocols; Cross-chain asset transfer; Crossdefi protocol; Decentralised; Decentralized finance; Finality guarantee in the blockchain; Smart contract security","","","","Popchev, Ivan P., Oracles Integration in Blockchain-Based Platform for Smart Crop Production Data Exchange, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 10, (2023); Appl Comput Eng, (2023); Sathya, A.

Applying a mixed methodology of interviews and AMOS analysis that aims at collecting reliable data from financial and inventory managers in Jordan, this research indicates that the most considerable elements in developing supply chain finance in Jordan are credibility and sustainability. Guaranteeing fair access to funds and contentious innovation has proven to be a complete policy. Moreover, the results conclude that balancing regulatory support is related to simplicity, collaboration, and endorsement of worldwide access to technology. For further research within the same domain, this research recommends developing a customized SCF program and emerging inclusive policies that can pave the way for future research as a comparative analysis of diverse businesses and the study of its permanent effect, devising the integration of technology strategies and mentoring the effectiveness of financial policies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comprehensive policies; Jordanian industrial businesses; Small and medium enterprises; Supply Chain Finance","","","","The authors thank the Middle East University, Jordan for the APC funding.","International Journal of Business and Economics Research, (2020); Al-Eitan, Ghaith N., Trade Credit Management and Profitability of Jordanian Manufacturing Firms, Risks, 11, 1, (2023); Ali, Ahmad Atieh, The Role of Supply Chain Integration on Project Management Success in Jordanian Engineering Companies, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 299, pp. 646-657, (2022); Ali, Ahmad Atieh, The Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Supply Chain Resilience on the Companies Supply Chains Performance: The Moderating Role of Supply Chain Dynamism, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 550 LNNS, pp. 17-28, (2023); Ali, Ahmad Atieh, The Impact of Humanitarian Supply Chain on Non-Government Organizations Performance Moderated by Organisation Culture, International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning, 18, 3, pp. 763-772, (2023); Alkhatib, Saleh Fahed, Supply Chain Resilience and Operational Performance: The Role of Digital Technologies in Jordanian Manufacturing Firms, Administrative Sciences, 13, 2, (2023); Allahham, Mahmoud Izzat Othman, Big Data Analytics and AI for Green Supply Chain Integration and Sustainability in Hospitals, WSEAS Transactions on Environment and Development, 19, pp. 1218-1230, (2023); Almansour, Bashar Yaser, Small and medium size enterprise: Access the financial and non-financial factors, Management Science Letters, 9, 5, pp. 687-694, (2019); Almasarweh, Mohammad Salameh, The impacts of task technology fit, transparency, and supply chain agility on the blockchain adoption by SMEs in Jordan, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 3, pp. 1303-1310, (2023); Alrifai, Koutibah, The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Project Performance in Construction Companies in Palestine, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 550 LNNS, pp. 71-82, (2023)","","Growing Science","","","","","","22916822; 22916830","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197701398"

Banks are not unaffected by this, as they face many future challenges and are thus directly affected by narratives. For this reason, this article aims to reveal the future prospects within the academic landscape on the basis of a scoping literature review to create transparency about where the narratives come from. So, it is not the intention to make another prediction about the future of the banks. The paper presents contributions that make explicit statements about the future of banks, either a description of the future or an assessment of the future prospects of banks. Two databases were searched in this context, IDEAS/RePEc and Scopus, for the period from 2001 to 2021. A total of 99 relevant contributions were identified and finally used to answer three questions: (1) What challenges are seen for banks in the future? (2) What kind of future is depicted? (3) How are the future prospects derived? It turns out that challenges are seen in profitability, regulation, technology, and customer behaviour. The future prospects vary considerably, which puts the focus on the last question. Among other things, an overemphasis on intermediation theory tends to generate negative future prospects. It can be seen that the importance of the assumptions for the derivation of future prospects has not yet been recognised and further research is necessary to get a more complete picture of the future of banks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banks; Future; Literature review; Narratives","","","","","Future of Banking, (2003); Alam, Nafis, Do Islamic banks shift from mark-up to equity financing when their contracting environments are improved?, Applied Economics Letters, 24, 8, pp. 545-548, (2017); Allen, Franklin, China's financial system: Growth and risk, Foundations and Trends in Finance, 9, 3-4, pp. 197-319, (2014); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arestis, Philip, Washington consensus and financial liberalization, Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, 27, 2, pp. 251-271, (2004); Financial Liberalization Beyond Orthodox Concerns, (2005); Ariff, Mohamed, Islamic banking in Malaysia: The changing landscape, Institutions and Economies, 9, 2, pp. 1-13, (2017); Arksey, Hilary, Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework, International Journal of Social Research Methodology: Theory and Practice, 8, 1, pp. 19-32, (2005); Monetary and Economic Studies, (2002); Forefront, (2013)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","21981639; 21981620","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149127530"

However, one of the significant challenges faced by the market is the transfer of ownership of ṣukūk assets to ṣukūk holders, mainly due to legal restrictions, particularly in sovereign ṣukūk issuance. The study explores the concept of ownership in Sharīʿah and discusses pertinent contemporary issues in the sale contract as a means of transferring ownership of sovereign sukuk assets. This research employs a qualitative doctrinal methodology to scrutinize literature pertaining to ownership through a Sharīʿah lens. The analysis centers on the attributes of ownership and methods of acquisition, while also delving into significant Shariah considerations surrounding the transfer of sovereign sukuk ownership, as well as divergent perspectives on terms within sales agreements. Deepening the Shariah perspective of ownership transfer for sustainable Sukuk issuance is the sine qua non for alignment between the Shariah and regulatory requirements. This study found that the clarity on the Shariah position of the ownership of Sukuk holders will ensures tradability, security, and protection of Sukuk holders, hence actualizing the sustainable Sukuk issuance in the Sukuk markets. These findings shed light on the challenges and considerations surrounding the transfer of ownership in the ṣukūk market, providing insights into the role of legal constraints and the importance of aligning transactions with Sharīʿah principles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ownership transfer; Shariah perspective; Sovereign Sukuk; Sukuk issuance","","","","The authors acknowledged the supports of INCEIF University and International Islamic University Malaysia in providing necessary materials in carrying out the research work.","Challenges of Profit and Loss Sharing Financing in Malaysian Islamic Banking, (2016); Abdul Razak, Lutfi, The concept and application of ḍamān al-milkiyyah (ownership risk): Islamic law of contract perspective, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 9, 2, pp. 148-163, (2017); Al Milkiyyah Wa Nazariyyat Al Aqdf Al Shar at Al Hlamiyyah, (2025); Shari Ah Standards, (2015); Al Milkiyyah Fi Al Shariah Al Islamiyyah Maa Al Muqaranah Bi Al Sharai Al Wadiyyah, (2025); A Critical Analysis of Special Purpose Vehicles in the Islamic Banking Industry the Kingdom of Bahrain as A Case Study, (2016); Quyd Al Milkiyyah Al Khah; Al Sail Al Jarar Al Mutadaffiq Ala Hadaiq Al Azhar, (2004); Paper Presented at the 9th International Shariah Scholars Forum, (2014); Al Hawi Al Qudusi Fi Furu Fiqh Al Hanafi, (2011)","","USIM Press","","","","","","22321047; 01278886","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005975677"

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach has been used consisting of 62 completed surveys with closed-ended and open-ended questions, follow-up comments and five in-depth interviews with hoteliers in the mid-Sweden region. Content analysis has been employed. Findings: Three categories of meanings are the main findings: general perception, safeguarding Swedish secular values and financially unjustifiable have been discovered. Most of the respondents have been sceptical towards halal and Muslim-friendly hotel concepts due to financial and cultural challenges these two concepts have for the Swedish tourism and hotel industries. Based on the SET, this entails more costs than benefits and is especially at odds with Swedish-rooted secular values. Practical implications: This study provides practical implications and increased knowledge for tourism stakeholders including hotels in Sweden. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies on halal tourism in Scandinavia and the first Scandinavian study on hoteliers' attitudes towards halal tourism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Halal tourism; Muslim-friendly tourism; Secularism; Social exchange theory; Swedish hoteliers","","","","","Abbasian, Saeid, Good idea but not here! a pilot study of swedish tourism stakeholders’ perceptions of halal tourism, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 5, pp. 1-17, (2021); Kne Social Sciences, (2020); Abror, Abror, The impact of Halal tourism, customer engagement on satisfaction: moderating effect of religiosity, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 24, 7, pp. 633-643, (2019); Abror, Abror, Antecedents of word of mouth in Muslim-friendly tourism marketing: the role of religiosity, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 12, 4, pp. 882-899, (2021); Adel, Ahmed M., Halal strategies on official government tourism websites: An extension and validation study, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 21, 2, pp. 229-244, (2021); Adirestuty, Fitranty, CUSTOMER-PERCEIVED VALUE IN CREATING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND REVISIT INTENTION IN SHARIA HOTELS, Journal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance, 5, 2, pp. 367-368, (2019); Tourism Critiques Practice and Theory, (2021); Aji, Hendy Mustiko, The determinants of Muslim travellers’ intention to visit non-Islamic countries: a halal tourism implication, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 12, 8, pp. 1553-1576, (2021); Al-Ansi, Amr, Role of halal-friendly destination performances, value, satisfaction, and trust in generating destination image and loyalty, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 13, pp. 51-60, (2019); Al-Ansi, Amr, Islamophobia: Differences across Western and Eastern community residents toward welcoming Muslim tourists, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 51, pp. 439-450, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","25149806; 25149792","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175522066"

Whereas ethics is based on the moral and religious understanding of good and evil, adherence to religious norms is vital for many nations. In Islam, privacy is a fundamental value that is deeply rooted in the principles of Shariah law and focuses on the dignity of the individual, personal boundaries and moral behaviour. Therefore, the use of AI technologies by Islamic nations raises concerns about the compatibility of these traditional privacy norms with ethical frameworks for AI. To ensure that the field of AI is not only innovative but also morally and religiously acceptable, an optimal balance between ethical governance and technological advancement must be maintained. This study examines the approaches of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in integrating Islamic ethics and privacy rules into their ethical frameworks for AI. The study utilised qualitative methods, including descriptive and content analyses, combined with a comparative approach from data collected through documentary method. The transition from Islamic ethics to digital Islamic ethics experienced the significant influence of Islamic business ethics, which places a strong emphasis on justice, accountability and human dignity. Future studies on digital Islamic ethics need to follow the pace of technological advancement and identify the future ethical risks and gaps. The Islamic concept of privacy is unique. It differs from the Western legal approach in that it emphasises the importance of adherence to Shariah teachings and provides a strict and clear explanation for desirable behaviour in doubtful and ambiguous cases. The digital age requires the evolution of the Islamic concept of privacy to address the ethical and legal challenges posed by technological advances. The ethical frameworks for AI adopted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates illustrate the integration of cultural and ethical values with technological innovation. The governments attach great importance to harmonising security and privacy with Islamic principles. Both countries demonstrate how universal ethical rules for AI can be adapted to national circumstances. A customised ethical framework will therefore not only promote innovation and technological progress, but also ensure that these are in line with national ethical standards, cultural and religious values and societal needs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; digital environment; ethics; Islam; Privacy","","","","","Abdallah, Salam, Islamic ethics: An exposition for resolving ICT ethical dilemmas, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, 8, 3, pp. 289-301, (2010); Abokhodair, Norah, Privacy & social media in the context of the Arab Gulf, pp. 672-683, (2016); Architecture and Behaviour Journal, (1996); Journal of Contemporary Administration and Management Adman, (2023); Ahmad, Ahmad Atif, Islam, modernity, violence, and everyday life, pp. 1-213, (2009); Right to Privacy in the Islamic Jurisprudence, (2018); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2025); Al Maqasid the International Journal of Maqasid Studies and Advanced Islamic Research, (2024); Zaid, Bouziane, Digital Islam and Muslim Millennials: How Social Media Influencers Reimagine Religious Authority and Islamic Practices, Religions, 13, 4, (2022); International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, (2022)","","Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","","","","","","25904396; 19857454","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214283073"

This study aims to analyze the impact of product innovation, service quality, and transaction security on customer satisfaction and loyalty in Islamic banks in Makassar. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS was applied to data collected from 400 Islamic bank customers. The results indicate that service quality (estimate 0.253, C.R. 3.229) and transaction security (estimate 1.581, C.R. 3.216) have a significant impact on customer satisfaction. Product innovation also significantly affects customer satisfaction (estimate 0.723, C.R. 6.484) but does not significantly influence loyalty (estimate 0.130, C.R. 0.545, P 0.693). Conversely, customer satisfaction significantly affects loyalty (estimate 0.234, C.R. 2.534, P 0.027).

This paper aims to present features of Shariah-compliant security tokens and supporting ecosystems that can provide additional sources of financing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and create alternative investment opportunities for retail investors. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper presents the building blocks of security tokens, their ecosystem and key functions and activities and then examines these features from Islamic perspectives. This is done by reviewing the contemporary literature on cryptoassets and their ecosystems and analysing these in light of Islamic legal and ethical values and principles. Findings: The paper provides a framework of how Shariah-compliant asset- and equity-based security tokens can be used by SMEs to raise funds quickly and efficiently on crypto exchanges. Given the novelty and complexity of the technology involved and the lack of understanding and skills to develop blockchain-based systems among SMEs, this paper suggests developing security tokens and exchanges in a controlled manner under the supervision of a nation’s stock markets. Originality/value: Although several studies examine cryptocurrencies from Islamic perspectives, literature on other cryptoassets and their role in financial inclusion is scant.

To ascertain the legitimacy and possible adoptability of cryptocurrency under Sharīʿah law, this paper employs qualitative research methods, using in-depth interviews of twenty-four Sharīʿah scholars. These scholars, selected through purposive and snowball sampling techniques, possess expert knowledge of both cryptocurrency and the Islamic financial system. The results revealed that the acceptability of cryptocurrency in Sharīʿah-compliant financial systems is contingent on its centralization and its function as a store of value, aligning with the objectives (maqasid) of Sharīʿah. Cryptocurrency's lack of intrinsic value necessitates its backing by a central authority or asset to mitigate risks and potential fraud.

Design/Methodology/Approach — The paper used an interview method to obtain information related to Islamic estate planning of crypto assets. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with informants of five different backgrounds including lawyers, estate planners, Sharīʿah experts, digital asset exchange (DAX) operators, and crypto owners. The data gathered was analysed using thematic analysis to construct the framework of Islamic estate planning of crypto assets. Findings — The paper identifies important prerequisites of Islamic estate planning of crypto assets. Further, a framework of estate planning of crypto assets is developed based on the information gathered from all related stakeholders. It is posited that the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has a vital role to play in safeguarding the financial interests of digital asset holders and their beneficiaries and that implementation of this framework would align with and uphold the objectives of Sharīʿah (maqāṣid al-Sharīʿah). Originality/Value — This paper presents a framework of Islamic estate planning of crypto assets, it being one of the first studies to do so from the Islamic perspective, which is not only useful and relevant for Malaysians (Muslims) but also for other countries. Research Limitations/Implications — The first limitation of the paper is that the framework is developed based on a qualitative method. There is no evidence of its validity, which is a gap that can be explored in the future. Second, it involves the perceptions of five types of respondents, which may be broadened to other related stakeholders such as regulators—i.e., Securities Commissions or any ministries—in future studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crypto asset; Digital asset; Intergenerational transfer; Islamic estate planning; Sharīʿah","","","","Our appreciation goes to the Ministry of Higher Education for the financial support of this study under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/SS01/UUM/02/9) and to Universiti Utara Malaysia for facilitating the management of the research.","Aziz, Ahmad Shamsul Abd, The Money of The Future: A Study of The Legal Challenges Facing Cryptocurrencies, BiLD Law Journal, 7, 1, pp. 21-33, (2022); Journal of Islam in Asia, (2020); New Breeze, (2020); Abd Wahab, Norazlina, Shariah Perspective on Crypto as Asset (Mal): Justifying the Needs of Estate Planning and Inheritance of Digital Asset, International Journal of Islamic Thought, 24, 1, pp. 157-167, (2023); Australian Taxation Office Ato Community, (2021); Cryptocurrency an Holistic and Contemporary Syariah Analysis Part V; Estate Planning Studies and Briefs, (2011); Spring Conference National College of Probate Judges, (2019); Schlun Elseven, (2023); Halal Cryptocurrency Management, (2019)","","International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA)","","","","","","22894365; 01281976","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200413888"

It is because the Zakat Management Organization and online platforms that facilitate zakat payments online still need legal certainty regarding collecting, using, and reporting personal data about zakat payers (muzakki). There needs to be more clarity on the types of muzakki's personal data that can be collected and reported by Zakat Management Organization and online platforms to the government, which creates the potential for a muzakki's personal data breach. This article uses normative legal research methods with statutory and conceptual approaches. In conclusion, a mutually agreed-upon personal data protection agreement is required between Zakat Management Organization, the online platform, and muzakki.

This study delves into the semantics and ontology for developing a Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) profile in the context of Pakistan’s Land Administration Systems (LASs), which currently face issues due to manual record-keeping, lack of transparency, frauds, and disintegration. Establishing a baseline through Record of Rights (RoR) and Property Information Report (PIR), alongside surveying and mapping procedures defined by laws and rules, forms the foundation for LADM profile development. This study explores the transition from manual LAS to 2D/3D representation, using LADM as a conceptual guideline. The LADM profile’s three key packages—PK_Party, PK_Administrative, and PK_SpatialUnit—a sub-package, and external classes are examined, with proposals for digitalisation and modernisation. Additionally, the study includes expert consultation, and highlights the significant support that the LADM implementation offers to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Pakistan. In conclusion, the study underscores the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to address organisational overlaps and ambiguities within LAS, positioning PK LADM as a transformative force for sustainable urban LAS in Pakistan, aligning with broader SDGs. Recommendations include exploring realistic land valuation, integrated ownership and location verification systems, addressing historical survey data challenges, and promoting wider stakeholder adoption for sustainable 2D/3D urban LAS using LADM and its edition II as a way forward towards the creation of a smart city and digital twin. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D LAS; LADM; land administration; land tenure; real estate; SDGs; urban planning","cadastre; land management; land market; land tenure; Sustainable Development Goal; urban planning; Pakistan","","","Authors acknowledge the expert consultation support from the following participants, including Khubaib Abuzar and Rana M.

The study used non-probability convenience and snowballing sampling approaches to collect data. The study collects a sample of 210 respondents targeting bankers in various positions from the Indian commercial banks. The study used structural equation modeling to estimate the results. The findings highlight the complex links between IT governance, FinTech, and sustainability-related concerns, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustainability. Banks can establish more complete strategies for sustainable growth by considering IT governance, FinTech, and ESG factors. The findings reveal that IT governance is critical in shaping banks’ strategic planning towards sustainable activities, evolution of Fintech, and technological advancements, which in turn influence significantly and positively sustainability performance. IT governance leads to increased adoption of Fintech and enhances sustainability performance, contributing to the growth of economic sustainability. Banks that strategically utilize IT governance to foster Fintech and sustainability performance improvements likely experience economic gains due to their focus on sustainable and technologically driven practices. The findings emphasize the importance of balancing sustainability efforts and suggest that banks that embrace IT governance while emphasizing ESG factors are more likely to embrace better sustainability performance.

Based on data from 214 Chinese manufacturers, we employ the structural equation model to test our conceptual model and hypotheses. The results indicate that relationship quality and customer involvement positively and negatively affect switching costs, respectively, and that switching costs negatively affect NPD performance. Switching costs mediate and moderate the relationship between social capital and NPD performance.

In this context, the present study aims to formulate a model for Ph.D. supervisor selection from the offered alternatives in an academic institute. A hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework has been applied to select the suitable supervisor of the student's preferred criteria under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) scenario. The IVIF Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to prioritize the criteria, whereas IVIF Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) technique is engaged to rank the available supervisors based on criteria weight. A set of eight criteria and five alternatives have been considered for modeling the problem. Moreover, the potential criteria are weighted and ranked by the multiple decision makers in the present study. To examine the consistency and robustness of the proposed integrated approach, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis have been carried out. From all the analyses, it can be conferred that the suggested approach is quite useful to apply in different decision-making scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AHP; Interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy number; PhD supervisor selection; Research institute; TOPSIS","","","","","How to Get A Phd A Handbook for Students and their Supervisors, (2000); Hasan, Mir Anamul, A multi-criteria decision support system for Ph.D. Supervisor selection: A hybrid approach, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2019-January, pp. 1823-1832, (2019); International Journal of Doctoral Studies, (2007); Ives, Glenice, Supervisor selection or allocation and continuity of supervision: Ph.D. students' progress and outcomes, Studies in Higher Education, 30, 5, pp. 535-555, (2005); International Journal of Vocational and Technical Education, (2009); Journal of Management and Strategy, (2011); Interdisciplinary Management Research, (2014); van Rooij, Els Cornelia Maria, Factors that influence PhD candidates’ success: the importance of PhD project characteristics, Studies in Continuing Education, 43, 1, pp. 48-67, (2021); Jabre, Loay J., Ten simple rules for choosing a PhD supervisor, PLOS Computational Biology, 17, 9, (2021); Cardilini, Adam P.A., Supervising the PhD: identifying common mismatches in expectations between candidate and supervisor to improve research training outcomes, Higher Education Research and Development, 41, 3, pp. 613-627, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26667207","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187361438"

Understanding the factors that influence Muslim consumers’ purchasing behaviour is crucial to accelerate the growth in the family takaful market segment. However, research has yet to adequately address the drivers of family takaful purchase behaviour. By integrating religious obligation into the theory of planned behaviour, this study proposed and tested a model of the factors underlying family takaful purchasing behaviour, and further examined the moderating impact of gender. The findings show that Muslim consumers’ intentions to purchase family takaful are influenced by attitude and subjective norm, and purchasing behaviour is influenced by intention and perceived behavioural control. Although religious obligation affects attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control, its influence on family takaful purchasing intention and purchasing behaviour is not supported. These findings differ across male and female groups, emphasising the centrality of gender as a moderator and a boundary condition in the relationships posited in the model. The findings have various theoretical and managerial implications which are highlighted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Family takaful; Intention to purchase; Purchasing behaviour; Religious obligation; Theory of planned behaviour","","","","Open access funding provided by University of Johannesburg.

It differentiates from prior research by not solely focusing on the 2008 financial crisis. Data from a survey of 220 bank employees were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Key findings include the necessity of well-informed boards and robust governance structures that adhere to regulations for effective risk management. Open communication with stakeholders and stringent control over technological risks are also vital due to the banking sector's increased technology reliance.

A composite index was constructed by principal component analysis using data extracted from the world development indicators, with the components mobile money usage, digital financial services, and velocity of money. The estimation utilised an impulse response function and vector error correction model; the results indicated that mobile money, digital financial services, and money velocity are related in both the short and long term. Furthermore, the application of a standard deviation innovation to the velocity of money produced increases of both positive and negative magnitude for all the variables. This suggests that mobile money, digital banking services, and velocity of money in Ghana are interdependent in an asymmetric manner. In order to facilitate an increase in the velocity of money, the research concluded that policymakers should guarantee that a greater proportion of the population has access to mobile money and digital banking services. In addition to promoting mobile money, online banking services, and digital payment methods on purpose, the government should reduce reliance on physical currency and expedite the circulation of money.

To address this issue, this study introduced green microfinance institutions based on Mayoux’s Feminist Empowerment Theory. The objective of this study is to examine the role of green microfinance institutions in women economic freedom in China. A survey questionnaire is used to collect data from female clients of microfinance institutions. 315 respondents responded to the survey and data analysis is carried out by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results of the study identified that, green microfinance institution’s services such as credit and insurance can facilitate green micro enterprises. The promotion of green micro enterprises causes to increase women economic security, leading to the economic free-dom.

It has not been entirely implemented in the Islamic financial industry because it is unstable and there are debates regarding its conformity with Shariah principles. Since the development of the smart contract is still in the preliminary stages, its position in an Islamic contract is yet to be determined. Does a smart contract blockchain comply with Islamic contract theory? This qualitative study aims to analyse the smart contract’s position based on Islamic contract theory. Data were obtained using content analysis and interview methods, in which the semi-structured interview involved Islamic financial experts and industry players. Data were then analysed using the QDA Miner version 5.0.31 software. Findings indicate that a smart contract differs from other contracts because it records every transaction using hash cryptography and computer codes known as solidity. Besides that, transactions did not adhere to two principles of an Islamic contract, namely the existence of autonomy in the contracting parties and the ability to manipulate the contract. Hence, Shariah-based risks in a smart contract can be decreased by improving the Shariah compliance aspect in the transaction to solve autonomy issues and the manipulation of contracts. The study implies that a smart contract has the potential to become an innovation in the Islamic financial industry if it can adhere to the principles of an Islamic contract and it can be monitored by relevant authorities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; Islamic contract; Islamic finance; Smart contract","","","","","undefined; International Seminar on Islamic Jurisprudence in Contemporary Society at Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, (2017); International Journal of Advanced Research, (2020); Perbankan Islam, (2016); Frontiers in Blockchain, (2020); A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform, (2014); Iqtishoduna Jurnal Ekonomi Islam, (2021); Islamic Financial Services Industry Stability Report, (2016); Revue De Gestion Et D Economie, (2018); International Conference on Islamic Economic, (2022)","","Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry","","","","","","25493167; 25493132","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186172626"

The purpose of this article is to clarify how incorporating blockchain technology would affect estate operations and governance. This study is based on quantitative information that was collected from 317 estate management professionals using a 5point Likert scale questionnaire. SmartPLS4 analysis demonstrates that blockchain governance has a statistically significant and robust influence on estate governance in Jordan. The impact of Blockchain Governance on Jordanian Estate Management appears to be negligible and unimportant. Furthermore, there appears to be a negligible and insignificant correlation between Jordanian estate management and estate planning methods. In-depth analysis of these theories is done in this article, which also offers insights into how blockchain technology affects estate governance dynamics and how it can affect Jordan's estate management procedures. The consequences go beyond theoretical understandings; they promote the use of blockchain technology in estate governance frameworks as a game-changing means of ensuring the safe, transparent, and effective administration of frozen estates in Jordan and elsewhere. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficiency and Transparency; Estate Jordan; Evaluating Security; Governance; Management","","","","","Journal of Administrative Sciences and Fintech Jasf, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2022); Abdullah, Muhamad Muizz, A Literature Review on Islamic Estate Planning From Year 2014 to 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice, 2020, pp. 1-29, (2020); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Ahmad, Iftikhar, Real estate management via a decentralized blockchain platform, Computers, Materials and Continua, 66, 2, pp. 1813-1822, (2020); undefined, (2010); Ahmad, Rohana Binti, Stress among staff in public service organizations: Mapping the relationship between team conflict, personality, and job demands towards job stress, International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 9, 12, pp. 152-161, (2022); Ahmed, Eman Abdulazeem, Comparison of specific segmentation methods used for copy move detection, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 13, 2, pp. 2363-2374, (2023); Risk Management on Inheritance from A Tax Perspective, (2024)","","Growing Science","","","","","","25618156; 25618148","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185464613"

The findings support our maintained assumption that due to the economics of electronic platforms perused by financial technology firms, these firms outperform firms from other industries (non-Fintech). The final sample comprises 1,712 company-year observations between 2010 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19). The evidence suggests that our corporate governance quality index, developed from Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (www.oecd.org/corporate/corporate-governance-factbook.htm, 2019) guidelines, accurately captures corporate governance quality in the United States, principally due to the inclusion of an anti-bribery policy indicator, in the index. The results suggest that this evidence is not merely an artefact due to the corporate governance quality index potentially capturing priced risk factors. Our findings reveal that fintech firms have superior corporate governance quality than non-fintech and that fintech firms place more reliance on internal versus external corporate governance mechanisms, vis-a-vis companies in other industries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency costs; Corporate governance (CG); COVID-19; Financial technology firms; Performance; Regulations","Costs; Industrial economics; Agency costs; Corporate governance; Electronic platforms; Financial technology firm; Firm Performance; Organization of economic co-operation and development; Performance; Quality indices; Regulation; COVID-19","","","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the funding and research support received from Sunway University, Malaysia.

As one of the leading wheat importers, Egypt has been adversely affected by the simultaneous occurrence of these two events. Baladi bread is an integral part of the daily diet in Egypt, so any disruption affecting its availability can have a severe impact on the country’s food security. This study aims to simulate the causes and effects of potential disruptions that could occur, such as increased transportation time, unavailability of sourcing, and surge in demand due to lockdowns and panic buying. The East Cairo region was chosen as a case study to model the Baladi bread supply chain. A discrete-event simulation model was developed using anyLogistix software (version 2.15.1) for this study. Five key performance indicators were selected to evaluate, analyze, and compare the outcomes of each scenario in terms of the performance and operation of the food supply chain: service level by product, lead time, demand backlog, average daily available inventory in the mills, and on-hand inventory of wheat in the silos. The results indicate that the supply chain has been significantly impacted by the disruptions caused by these two events, leading to decreased availability of Baladi bread, unmet demand, extended lead times, and high backlogs. By utilizing the research findings, proactive strategies can be developed to minimize the impact of such disruptions in the future and maximize food security and supply chain resilience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bread; COVID-19; food supply chain; Russian–Ukrainian war; service level; simulation","COVID-19; food security; food supply; simulation; software; supply chain management; wheat; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt","","","","Mari, Sonia Irshad, Sustainable and resilient supply chain network design under disruption risks, Sustainability (Switzerland), 6, 10, pp. 6666-6686, (2014); Elkington, John, Partnerships from cannibals with forks: The triple bottom line of 21st-century business, Environmental Quality Management, 8, 1, pp. 37-51, (1998); Mostafa, Noha A., Promoting organizational sustainability and innovation: An exploratory case study from the Egyptian chemical industry, Procedia Manufacturing, 22, pp. 1007-1014, (2018); Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, (2020); Huremović, Damir, Psychiatry of Pandemics: A Mental Health Response to Infection Outbreak, pp. 1-185, (2019); Adjusting Business Models to Sustain Agri Food Enterprises During Covid 19, (2020); Di Domenico, Laura, Impact of lockdown on COVID-19 epidemic in Île-de-France and possible exit strategies, BMC Medicine, 18, 1, (2020); Ren, Xuefei, Pandemic and lockdown: a territorial approach to COVID-19 in China, Italy and the United States, Eurasian Geography and Economics, 61, 4-5, pp. 423-434, (2020); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Ijief, (2021); undefined, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184697338"

The authors use an extended version of the technology acceptance model to develop a causal–predictive analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The research model and hypotheses were tested by applying partial least square-structured equation modeling to data collected from 214 users of Islamic banking in Saudi Arabia. Findings: The results show that perceived trust has a highly significant direct effect on the intention to use Islamic Paytech services, whereas perceived risk has a significant indirect effect on IU. Research limitations/implications: Internet banking behavior may not be static. In technology acceptance, during the various phases from introduction to the maturity phase, the respondent’s perceptions tend to change Practical implications: From the point of view of Fintech services providers, the knowledge of the factors fostering the adoption of Fintech services would allow an international expansion without the inconvenience of establishing offices or companies in countries whose legislation does not favor the operations carried out by Islamic banks. Social implications: These digital payment services would allow access to financial services to the entire Muslim population regardless of their location (Islamic and non-Islamic nations) and will also reach out to the next generation of young Muslims as a majority are “digital natives” ready for digital Islamic financial solutions. Originality/value: This study is the first to explore the intention to use Paytech services by Islamic banking users in Saudi Arabia. From a theoretical perspective, this work contributes to the academic literature by analyzing the intention to use Paytech services in an Islamic banking context. On the practical front, the study identifies the crucial factors that industry players can use to design their Paytech applications and services to increase financial inclusion in Saudi Arabia and other countries with similar cultures as well as to design an international expansion without the inconvenience of establishing offices or companies in countries whose legislation does not favor the operations carried out by Islamic banks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Extended TAM; Intention to use; Islamic Fintech; Islamic Paytech; PLSpredict","","","","Funding: This research was funded by the University of Seville under grant to the Research Group [SEJ-566].","Libro Blanco De Paytech, (2020); Nawayseh, Mohammad, Fintech in COVID-19 and beyond: What factors are affecting customers’ choice of fintech applications?, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 6, 4, pp. 1-15, (2020); International Journal of Managing Information Technology, (2016); Atif, Mohd, Islamic FinTech: The digital transformation bringing sustainability to islamic finance, pp. 91-103, (2021); Ayub, Muhammad, Understanding Islamic Finance, pp. 1-516, (2015); Banna, Hasanul, Fintech-based financial inclusion and bank risk-taking: Evidence from OIC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 75, (2021); Marketing Research, (2000); Chishti, Susanne, The PayTech book: The payment technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs, and FinTech visionaries, pp. 1-242, (2019); Davis, Fred D.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Management Science, (1989)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17538394; 17538408","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160334283"

With current initiatives targeting coastal waters exceeding 200 meters deep, these areas yield sand, tin, and diamonds crucial for meeting the growing demand in the energy transition and new technologies. Unlike onshore mining, deep-sea mining lacks stringent national regulations, presenting an opportunity for Islamic finance. This alternative aligns with long-term investment principles, risk sharing, and environmental responsibility, addressing the absence of an international legal framework. The essay explores the benefits of Islamic finance in funding deep-sea mining, ensuring project viability, sustainability, and environmental preservation.

Employing a qualitative research method, this research will interview procurement managers and industry experts to obtain first-hand data from both sides. Findings indicate these digital technologies are enhancing procurement efficiencies, transparency, and strategic decision-making. In the same breath though, we learn that challenges remain such as how to meet regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions; who has access to what data (and when?); and what kind of staff to hire or develop. Three main themes arise from our data: how economic theories are being married up with digital procurement practices; obstacles in technology adoption; and innovative opportunities for diversity within procurement--transforming this division's structure or ways it interfaces with other parts out there. The study concludes with the finding that shared efforts are the key to knowing which way digital transformation is going. Put simply, Policymakers must join hands with business leaders and developers of technology to solve the complexities engendered by turning an industry around through digital means successfully.

Despite these advantages, crypto assets pose several challenges from a fiqh perspective. Firstly, there are discrepancies among researchers attempting to define them. Secondly, technological complexities have led to misunderstandings of their concept. Thirdly, there is a general misconception about their similarity to Bitcoin. Fourthly, there is a notable dearth of comprehensive fiqh studies on the topic. Therefore, this study has adopted a qualitative method to address these four research gaps in extant literature. It has critically reviewed the literature to identify the issues and propose a definition of crypto assets and has categorized them into six types. Content analysis research method was used to develop a conceptual framework for the fiqh analysis of crypto assets. The framework is expected to equip Muslim researchers and jurists with processes, risk analysis methods, and benchmarks to objectively evaluate a given crypto asset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crypto Assets; FinTech; Fiqh Framework; Islamic Economics; Risk Management","","","","","undefined, (2022); Blossom, (2017); 15th International Conference of the College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at the University of Sharjah on Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019); Fourth Doha Islamic Finance Conference, (2018); 15th International Conference of the College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at the University of Sharjah on Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019); 15th International Conference of the College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at the University of Sharjah on Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019); 15th International Conference of the College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at the University of Sharjah on Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019); 15th International Conference of the College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at the University of Sharjah on Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019); Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019); Virtual Currencies Under Evaluation, (2019)","","Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University (UIN) Jakarta","","","","","","14124734; 24078646","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217508643"

Investigating customers’ behavior is considered a primary element in adopting metaverse technologies in banking settings. This study combines the Trust Theoretic Model, Task-Technology Fit Model, and theory of planned behavior to explore consumers’ intentions to adopt metaverse Islamic mobile banking services in Jordan. Based on the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, the results using an electronic survey of 391 metaverse consumers among metaverse Islamic mobile banking services show that consumer trust based on its priors (perceived risk, perceived reputation, service quality, and perceived regulatory support) has a significant influence on consumer behavior intention at a significant P-value level (< 0.001). Furthermore, the results affirm that Task-Technology Fit plays a significant role in consumer behavior intention at a significant P-value level (< 0.001). Moreover, consumer behavior intention has a significant influence on consumers’ decision to adopt metaverse Islamic mobile banking services in Jordan at a significant P-value level (< 0.001). The findings of this study present critical insights for Islamic bank management in Jordan, assisting in developing their metaverse Islamic mobile banking, maintaining a strong relationship with consumers, and fostering consumer experiences.

The main research object of this paper is the digital currency that incorporates blockchain and smart contract technology, and it deeply examines how its generation and development impact economic policy and the corresponding regulatory mechanism. The application of blockchain and smart contract technology is used to analyze the characteristics and performance of digital currency, and the advantages and shortcomings of using digital currency are briefly explained. Based on the analysis of related research and practical application requirements, digital currency is being introduced into the DSGE model, which includes households, manufacturers, and other sectors. Impulse response and variance decomposition are used to numerically simulate the impact of digital currency on economic policy and the effectiveness of the regulatory mechanism. The economic policy transmission efficiency is the lowest in the no digital currency scenario, while it is significantly higher in the scenario of full use of digital currency, with interest rate shocks into the maximum degree of change in output and inflation of 0.059% and 0.121%. The variance of each macroeconomic variable in the economic policy regulation scenario shows a significant downward trend, and digital currency contributes to the overall regulation effect of macroeconomic policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Digital currency; DSGE model; Impulse response; Smart contract; Variance decomposition","Blockchain; Block-chain; Development impacts; DSGE models; Economic policies; Impact mechanism; Performance; Regulation mechanisms; Regulatory mechanism; Research object; Variance decomposition; Inflation","","","","Bis Quarterly Review, (2020); International Journal of Researchgranthaalayah, (2020); Implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies for Monetary Policy Transmission, (2023); Ozili, Peterson K., Central bank digital currency research around the world: a review of literature, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 26, 2, pp. 215-226, (2023); Keister, Todd, Central bank digital currency: Stability and information, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 142, (2022); Central Bank Digital Currency Motivations and Implications, (2017); Nber Reporter, (2018); Wu, Yanbing, A regulated digital currency, Science China Information Sciences, 62, 3, (2019); Lee, David Kuo Chuen, A global perspective on central bank digital currency, China Economic Journal, 14, 1, pp. 52-66, (2021); Rehman, Mubeen Abdur, Macro-financial implications of central bank digital currencies, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023)","","Sciendo","","","","","","24448656","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206811409"

Design/methodology/approach: Citation, conceptual and structural knowledge analyses were used through Biblioshiny to uncover current trends, impacts, and well-developed themes from 2274 journals. Findings: The results showed that there was a shift of focus to IB identity, governance and performance toward customer behavior related to the new generation, and the influence of digital technology such as blockchain, meta-verse, and social media platforms on the adoption of Islamic finance and banking services. Research limitations/implications: Further research enriching the current knowledge on IB’s economic impact, governance, identity and performance across different contexts must support the understanding since the result is related to the understanding of new generation customer behavior and technology adoption. Originality/value: The broader scope of the literature was reviewed for holistic analysis of issues and opportunities benefiting various stakeholders through interdisciplinary research.

Islamic Social Finance (ISF), especially through productive waqf instruments, is one of the prospective solutions to overcome this problem. Although Indonesia has enormous waqf potential, waqf realisation is still very low. There are several challenges in the waqf collection process, namely low literacy or public awareness, unprofessional management, and a lack of qualified human resources (nazhir). This research aims to determine the optimal productive waqf model to be implemented in Indonesia using the Delphi ANP-BOCR method. To strengthen the research results, this study also conducted a meta-analysis as a form of robustness check and a benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) analysis of each model as supporting arguments. The findings of this study show that Islamic banks as a way to leverage funds for waqf are the most prioritised model. This is because Islamic banks act as intermediary institutions that have great potential for optimising the collection and management of waqf funds, which can increase economic growth. This is reinforced by the results obtained from the meta-analysis and several supporting arguments, which show that Islamic financial institutions (including Islamic banks) can improve community welfare through the utilisation of social funds (including waqf). Besides that, this research also discusses an alternative model of productive waqf through digitalisation by adopting several technologies that aim to increase efficiency, transparency, and accessibility so as to optimise the collection and management of waqf funds more effectively and efficiently. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delphi ANP-BOCR; Islamic finance; Meta-analysis; Productive waqf","","","","","J Ekon Dan Kebijak Publik, (2015); Memahami Kembali Strategi Pengentasan Kemiskinan Di Indonesia, (2024); J Esa Unggul, (2007); Persentase Penduduk Miskin September 2022 Naik Menjadi 9 57 Persen, (2023); Iqtishaduna J Ilm Ekon Kita, (2019); Cattelan, Valentino, Islamic social finance: Entrepreneurship, cooperation and the sharing economy, pp. 1-222, (2018); Towards A Post Covid Global Financial System, (2022); Islamic Social Finance Report 2020, (2020); Tahiri-Jouti, Ahmed, An integrated approach for building sustainable Islamic social finance ecosystems, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 11, 2, pp. 246-266, (2019); Islamic Economic Studies, (1998)","","Learning Gate","","","","","","25768484","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205926196"

In the current era of information banking management, characterized by global interconnectedness and sustainability, the adoption of blockchain technology has brought about substantial changes in the banking sector. Despite the growing interest in blockchain’s applications within banking industry, both from academics and professionals in banking, finance, and fintech, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive review that offers a holistic understanding of the historical, current, and future trends of blockchain in banking. Existing reviews on blockchain in banking have primarily focused on conceptual aspects, such as constructing theoretical frameworks, or contextual elements, such as examining cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers. Consequently, these reviews offer a limited and incomplete understanding of the entire field. To bridge this gap, the present review takes a different approach by conducting a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 133 articles on blockchain published in Scopus-indexed journals from 2015 to May 2023. This methodology allows for a more extensive exploration of the literature, providing a more robust and comprehensive overview of blockchain’s application in the banking sector. Consequently, this comprehensive review uncovers significant trends in article performance, author contributions, country involvement, journal impact and theme within the field of blockchain research in banking.

To address this problem, a digital transformation of ISF is needed by leveraging technologies that come with both advantages and disadvantages. This study employs a Delphi ANP-BOCR analysis to determine the most optimal technology for ISF digitalization, which result is supported by meta-analysis findings. The result shows that cloud computing is the most optimal technology when only benefits and costs are evaluated. When all factors, including benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, are considered, digital platform proves to be the most optimal technology for both the short and long term. BOCR analysis also confirms that digital platform and cloud computing are the most optimal technology.

Data were collected through in-depth interviews with various e-commerce users, including consumers and producers. The results reveal that producers generally have a higher awareness of justice and ma maṣlaḥah in e-commerce, though their application of these principles varies. Consumers' experiences are inconsistent, often influenced by their educational background and exposure to Islamic commerce teachings. Key challenges include the lack of standardized guidelines and divergent interpretations of fiqh muamalah principles. The study underscores the need for more structured education and regulatory frameworks to ensure these principles' effective and consistent integration into e-commerce practices.

However, there is an obscurity with respect to protecting consumers’ rights and creating a reliable atmosphere for digital finance through legal framework in the digital banking sector in the Kingdom. The primary aims and objectives of this research is to scrutinize the digital banking consumers’ protection legal framework being overseen in Saudi Arabia, analyzing its content, mechanisms, and impact on different stakeholders. Similarly, the study tires to determine its efficacy as well as identify the roadblocks which can prevent its success. Through an extensive review and examination, the evaluation defines key issues, difficulties and finalizes statements about the legal field. The content analysis methodology was used to help address issues emanating from the existing literature. Various scholarly articles, policy documents, and regulatory guidelines were explored. In other words, data for this study were collected through different search sources such as journals, traditional articles of Google Scholar, policy documents, and library sources. A total of 25 articles were explored and contributed immensely to unveiling various aspects of the legal framework of digital banking as well as consumers’ protection in the Kingdom. The findings of this investigation have identified three basic themes on the domestic legal regulation of consumers’ protection in the digital banking system in Saudi Arabia. First, the study has analyzed various legislations such as: consumer protection law, sector-specific regulations, among others concerning the rights and duties of consumer protection. Second, legal obligations in seeking remedies when there is a discriminatory treatment in digital banking services. Third, it has been established that Saudi Arabia have taken a proactive step towards a robust safety cushion to protect the consumer rights and minimizing the risks involved in cybersecurity in the context of Saudi Arabia. Theoretically, on one hand, the study highlights the paramount significance to consumers’ protection legislations in the Kingdom. On the other hand, practically, the Kingdom’s witness of rapid economic growth and technological advancement, ensuring robust consumer protection measures becomes increasingly paramount to foster trust, promote fair business practices, and enhance consumer confidence in the marketplace. Nonetheless, some limitations such as insufficient consumers’ education and regulatory inadequacies were noted which need national coordination between stakeholders. Notwithstanding the fact that the legal framework exhibits strong points especially in addressing vital issues, its timely evaluation, amendment, and enforcement is deemed as a key to solve the emerging challenges and obtain confidence of consumers when it comes to digital banking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","consumer protection; digital banking and consumer rights; legal framework; Saudi Arabia","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication.","AboAlsamh, Hoda Mahmoud, Pioneering Perception of Green Fintech in Promoting Sustainable Digital Services Application within Smart Cities, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 14, (2023); Abu Ali, Mahmoud, The role of green infrastructure in enhancing microclimate conditions: A case study of a low-rise neighborhood in Abu Dhabi, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 8, (2021); Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi, Sustainable urban planning strategies for mitigating climate change in Saudi Arabia, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 22, 6, pp. 5129-5152, (2020); J Digit Bank, (2025); Investingating the Effect of Urban from on Heat Island Phenomena, (2017); Addas, Abdullah, Role of urban greening strategies for environmental sustainability-a review and assessment in the context of Saudi Arabian megacities, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Defense Associations for Bank Users Comparative Analysis of French and Saudi Practices, (2022); Ahmad, Naveed, Csr communication through social media: A litmus test for banking consumers’ loyalty, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-16, (2021); Aina, Yusuf Adedoyin, Top-down sustainable urban development?

This trend illustrates a profound transformation within the Islamic world, where the pillars of faith are being reimagined and revitalized through the lens of technological advancement. The present study delved into the factors influencing the young Muslim generation’s preference for digital platforms in Zakat transactions across Indonesia and Malaysia. We examined variables such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Trust, Zakat Literacy, and Digital Infrastructure, aiming to discern their impact on the propensity for digital Zakat contributions with the extension of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The research encompassed a diverse sample of 382 participants and utilized advanced methodologies, specifically Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS Multi Group Analysis (PLS-MGA), for rigorous data analysis. The results indicated that Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Digital Infrastructure, and Zakat Literacy notably influenced the use of digital platforms for Zakat. Furthermore, PLS-MGA uncovered significant cross-country differences where Digital Infrastructure showed a more pronounced positive impact in Malaysian context, whereas Social Influence had a greater effect in Indonesia. These findings offer critical insights into the young Muslim community’s digital engagement for religious financial obligations, underscoring the need for tailored digital Zakat solutions that cater to the unique preferences of this demographic. This research not only enriches the understanding of digital adoption in religious practices but also challenges the notion of a universal approach, advocating for context-specific strategies in the realm of digital religious financial services. Future researchers are suggested to consider longitudinal investigations as well as examining cross-regional contexts in this realm of research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital platforms; PLS-MGA; PLS-SEM; poverty alleviation; Zakat payments","","","","","International Journal of Islamic Business and Economics Ijibec, (2021); Islamic Economic Studies, (2023); Key to Happiness Indonesian, (2004); Al-Saedi, Karrar, Developing a general extended UTAUT model for M-payment adoption, Technology in Society, 62, (2020); Jurnal Manajemen, (2018); Technology Equality is the Key to National Awakening Cnbc Indonesia Indonesian, (2021); This is the Number of Muslim Population in the Asean Region Indonesia is the Largest, (2023); Jurnal Menara Ekonomi Penelitian Dan Kajian Ilmiah Bidang Ekonomi, (2018); World Scientific Annual Review of Islamic Finance, (2023); Fund Receipt Report Infak Id Indonesian, (2022)","","EnPress Publisher, LLC","","","","","","25727931; 25727923","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202917152"

The decision to launch a digital currency mainly depends upon the goals and objectives being set by the Central Bank of any respective country. Digital currencies help to implement monetary policy more effectively to achieve the financial system stability. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the Commonwealth of Independent States region; the digital payments market is changing rapidly in Kazakhstan, being driven by fintech innovations and public investments in payment technologies. In this article, we thoroughly discussed how launching of “Digital Tenge” is promoting financial inclusion and strengthening the monetary regulations across Kazakhstan. We took the case of Kazakhstan because it’s the first country from Central Asia which took the initiative of launching digital currency, and the National Bank of Kazakhstan has already announced that implementation of “Digital Tenge” would be completed in Kazakhstan by the end of 2025. The implementation of a “Digital Tenge” as a CBDC in Kazakhstan would expand the range of financial services being available to the nation. Having direct authority over the digital currency will empower the National Bank of Kazakhstan to adopt more efficient monetary policy, exerting influence over interest rates, money supply, and general economic stability. Furthermore, by providing digital financial services to marginalized communities, the digital Tenge would also help to solve the difficulties of financial inclusion in Kazakhstan. The article provides the possible policy routes for the governments of developing countries and the financial regulators about adopting CBDCs for promoting financial inclusion and to strengthen the monetary regulations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","central bank; digital tenge; financial inclusion; Kazakhstan; monetary policy","","","","","Agarwal, J.

To unlock the potential of waqf institutions, a supportive enabling environment is necessary. Hence, the issues of a conducive environment faced by the waqf stakeholders in Indonesia and Singapore need to be explored. Dual authorities’ roles are examined in addressing the issues. 22 in-depth interviews, 3 focus group discussions, observations, and reviews of relevant documents (regulations, reports, news, etc.) are conducted in Indonesia – a majority Muslim, and Singapore – a minority Muslim country. Collected data are then analysed thematically employing the lens of organisational legitimacy theory. This study shows that institutional challenges confound waqf developments as well as waqf stakeholders’ interest in the two countries under study. While the challenges faced by waqf institutions are prevalent in the existing regulatory environment, they also bring embedded consequences to waqf administration and policies. In Indonesia, the multiple conflicting roles of the Indonesian Waqf Board (Badan Wakaf Indonesia/BWI) and dual waqf authorities between the Ministry of Religious Authorities (Kementrian Agama/Kemenag) and BWI present institutional challenges that cause ineffective governing functions of waqf authorities. In Singapore, institutional challenges in the form of multiple roles of MUIS along with their government-affiliated policy direction raised concerns on conflict of roles and centralized administration, which caused national policy vis a vis social inclusion trade-off for the waqf. From the organizational legitimacy perspective, waqf authorities need to embrace the stakeholders’ expectations to focus on and enhance their roles as regulators and supervisors of the waqf sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Institutional Challenge; Legitimacy; Waqf; Waqf Authorities","","","","","A History of Philanthropic Foundations the Islamic World from the Seventh Century to the Present, (2000); Wife Uitm Occasional Papers, (2014); A Paper Presented at 17th Middle East History and Theory Conference, (2002); Embracing Waqf as A Lifestyle in Digital Era Opinion the Jakarta Post, (2019); Awqaf Experiences in South Asia, (2002); Amin, Hanudin, Determinants of online waqf acceptance: An empirical investigation, Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries, 60, 1, pp. 1-18, (2014); An Organisational Legitimacy Study on Governance of Waqf Authorities in Indonesia and Singapore, (2021); Sukmana, Raditya, Critical assessment of Islamic endowment funds (Waqf) literature: lesson for government and future directions, Heliyon, 6, 10, (2020); Islamic Wealth Management Inaugural Colloquium, (2013); International Journal of Not for Profit Law, (2016)","","Hamdard Foundation Pakistan","","","","","","02507196","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200927093"

The shortcomings could be resolved by introducing Web 3.0 to Malaysia's financial industry. This research aimed to explore the factors that influenced the adoption of Web 3.0 financial systems among Malaysian adults. Firstly, a Web 3.0 prototype system was developed with Web 3.0 design features. The web system’s interfaces were included in the questionnaire form, where 150 Malaysian adults were prompted to respond with their agreement on whether the factors of decentralization, security, transparency, accessibility, effectiveness, learnability, and ease of use are important and have positive significant relationships with intention to use Web 3.0 financial systems. The findings from hypothesis analysis found that only the factors of transparency, security, and accessibility had positive relationships with the intention to use Web 3.0 financial systems among Malaysian adults. The findings were later proposed as Malaysia Web 3.0 financial systems’ design framework, and further analyzed with the K-Means clustering method, for the benefit of Web 3.0 industry players to better understand adult users’ preferences.

This predicament stems from the rapid surge in infrastructure expansion over the past twenty years, which has led to a surge in construction and demolition activities. Regrettably, there is currently no effective sustainable strategy to curtail the influx of concrete waste into these landfills. The implications of such landfill accumulation extend beyond just environmental concerns, encompassing human health, resource depletion, and harm to ecosystems. In response, this study embarked on a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to contrast the existing landfilling and transportation practices for concrete waste with a proposed recycling approach. Conducted within the framework of ISO 14040:2006, the LCA was meticulously structured, with the EcoInvent 3.4 database and SimaPro 8.5.2.0 software employed to streamline its various phases and outcomes. The research did not stop at the environmental realm; it delved into the financial aspect, utilizing the Handbook Environmental Prices 2017 to determine the damage costs associated with each impact. The comparison, rooted in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), demonstrated a stark contrast between the environmental ramifications of landfilling versus recycling and transportation. The findings underscored the profound environmental toll of concrete waste deposition in landfills compared to the recycling method and transport process. By unearthing the disparities in impact indicators and management techniques for concrete waste, this study paves the way for future investigations to pinpoint influential factors. It also suggests the potential for a forthcoming Life Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA) to supplement this analysis, unraveling the financial benefits of various concrete waste management strategies, and transcending mere damage costs. In essence, this study significantly enriches the comprehension of damage cost modeling and offers LCA insights into concrete waste management, encompassing divergent approaches like landfilling, recycling, and transportation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete Waste; Life Cycle Assessment; Life Cycle Cost; Recycling; Sustainability; Waste Management","","","","","Journal of Law and Emerging Technologies, (2022); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The constitutional framework for public policy in the Middle East and North Africa countries, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 7, 3, pp. 187-203, (2021); Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023); Kurdish Studies, (2024); Bovea, María D., Developments in life cycle assessment applied to evaluate the environmental performance of construction and demolition wastes, Waste Management, 50, pp. 151-172, (2016); Bravo, Miguel, Thermal performance of concrete with recycled aggregates from CDW plants, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 7, 7, (2017); Cheng, Jack C.P., A BIM-based system for demolition and renovation waste estimation and planning, Waste Management, 33, 6, pp. 1539-1551, (2013); Mahdian Dehkordi, Nima Mahdian, Distributed Robust Finite-Time Secondary Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 32, 5, pp. 3648-3659, (2017); Elchalakani, Mohamed F., Green concrete with high-volume fly ash and slag with recycled aggregate and recycled water to build future sustainable cities, Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 29, 2, (2017); Essam, Sayed, Dubai Municipality Initiative to Reduce Food Loss, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 9, (2022)","","Collegium Basilea","","","","","","22352074; 16606795","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193939677"

Design/methodology/approach: This was a quantitative study that targeted millennial banking service customers from an emerging market environment. The non-probability sampling approach was used, and the data were collected via a survey questionnaire. For data analysis, SPSS and SmartPLS Structural equation modeling were used. Findings/results: The results confirmed a direct relationship between privacy, invasiveness and usefulness perception. It also confirmed a direct relationship between perceived usefulness and the intention to accept mobile-marketed banking services. In addition, the results also showed that in addition to the direct impact of perceived usefulness on intention to adopt mobile marketing usage for banking services, it acts as a mediator variable. Practical implications: Academics can pursue a qualitative study to unpack the reasons for sensitivity around banking technology in emerging markets. The study should lead to better understanding of both the investigated market and others like it. Organisations will gain valuable insight for informed investment in such markets. Originality/value: The article is the first empirical investigation into the adoption of mobile-marketed banking services by millennials in a developing economy context. The study adds a valuable component to academic debates by using two independent theories to gain a holistic view of the performance of advanced technology in banking business.

Its primary objectives are to elucidate how financial inclusion influences FDI and to examine the mediating role of economic growth and inflation as key factors. Key findings reveal a robust positive correlation between financial inclusion and FDI inflows within MENA countries. Specifically, the study uncovers significant relationships between FDI and the various dimensions of financial inclusion, including access, availability, and usage. This underscores the pivotal role of inclusive financial systems in attracting foreign investment. Moreover, the study highlights the symbiotic relationship between economic growth and FDI, indicating that heightened levels of economic prosperity attract greater investment. This underscores the importance of fostering conducive economic conditions to attract foreign capital. Furthermore, the study underscores the critical role of financial inclusion in shaping monetary policy and mitigating investment risks. By facilitating access to capital and reducing uncertainty, financial inclusion promotes transparency and stability, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of foreign markets for investment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial inclusion; foreign direct investment; GMM; MENA countries; panel data","","","","","Al-Okaily, Aws, Measuring success of accounting information system: Applying the delone and mclean model at the organizational level, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 98, 14, pp. 2697-2706, (2020); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., ORGANIZING EVENT UBIQUITOUS with A PROPOSED EVENT MOBILE APPLICATION in Bahrain, International Journal of Management, 11, 6, pp. 74-91, (2020); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., The Role of Industry 4.0 Technologies in Enabling Knowledge Management Practices: United Arab Emirates Perspective, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1999, pp. 145-156, (2024); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., An Ensemble Filter for Indoor Positioning Technology of Mobile Home Service with Agile iBeacon Deployment, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies, 17, 16, pp. 48-60, (2023); Al Omari, Rania Mohammad, The impact of profitability ratio on gross working capital of Jordanian industrial sector, International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research, 15, 26, pp. 421-428, (2017); Alshehadeh, Abdul Razzak, The impact of financial inclusion on bank performance: The case of Jordan, International Journal of Economics and Business Research, 20, 4, pp. 483-496, (2020); Al-Gasaymeh, Anwar S., Dynamic Model in Estimating the Impact of Competition on Banking Efficiency: Evidence form MENA Countries, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 193, pp. 385-394, (2023); Alghusin, Nawaf Salem, The impact of financial policy on economic growth in Jordan (2000-2017): An ardl approach, Ekonomski Pregled, 71, pp. 97-108, (2020); Alhawamdeh, Loai Naser, Do E-Service Quality and Digital Content Moderate the Relationship between Website Design and the Intention to visit the Museum?, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 194, pp. 143-150, (2023); Al-Khawaja, Haneen A., The COVID_19 Pandemic's Effects on Fintech in Banking Sector, Review of Economics and Finance, 21, 1, pp. 316-322, (2023)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18129358; 18104967","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192470595"

As a result, there is a growing need to incorporate sustainable frameworks into business decision-making. By focusing on sustainable performance at the firm level, we addressed a significant gap in understanding how environmental and social Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) impact bottom-line performance and the crucial role that effective country governance plays in implementing sustainability at the organization level. In 2015, the United Nations established Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where firms are encouraged to practice in the strategic operation of their businesses. In addition, country governance can play a significant role in adopting sustainable practices and policies that can impact bottom-line performance. In this study, we examined the relationship between environmental and social Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) practices, country governance, and firms’ financial performance from 2017 to 2021. The sample data set consisted of top-listed firms in the finance, manufacturing, and technology industries of 100 companies from 17 countries in developed and developing and emerging economies. We utilized content analysis to account for the qualitative aspects of how firms implement social and environmental SDGs. Ten environmental SDGs and eight social SDGs were incorporated in this study as a means of measuring sustainable development goals' impact on a firm’s financial performance. We adopted return on assets (ROA) to measure the firm’s financial performance. We adopted government effectiveness and regulatory quality to moderate the relationship between social and environmental sustainability practices and firm performance. The panel regression method was exercised to find out the relationship between environmental and social SDGs’ impact on financial performance. In addition, we measured the interaction effect between environmental and social SDGs and country governance on firms’ performance. We also deployed two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression estimation to mitigate endogeneity concerns. We found that environmental SDGs had a positive and significant impact on firms’ financial performance. The coefficient of social SDGs on firm performance was negative and statistically significant. We observed that the coefficient of interaction terms between environmental SDGs and country governance was positive and statistically significant. Moreover, the coefficient interaction terms between social SDGs and country governance were positive and statistically significant, lessening the negative impact of social SDGs on firm financial performance. Finally, we also performed a robustness test on our analysis based on the firm’s average capital and average assets.

They suffer from the ambiguity of contracts, and delays in reimbursement and do not feel the real impact of insurance in society. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative insurance based on blockchain and waqf. We suggest in this paper, to use smart contracts to create an efficient and automatic process in the collection of premiums and reimbursement of policyholders. The goal of this paper is to build insurance that reflects the true meaning of solidarity through Waqf while integrating transparency and speed through Fintech. This insurance model is supposed to be resilient in times of crisis, have a strong social impact, and be attractive to customers. Many advantages of the proposed model are discussed in the paper. In addition, the suggested insurance model will be represented through simulations on the NetLogo platform. We carry out the analysis in normal times and evaluate the behavior of policyholders in choosing a specific type of insurance, depending on some decision-making tools. We also analyze the impact of insurance during a time of crisis, as a particular example, the crisis experienced during the coronavirus pandemic.

Digital finance, in return, offers a means of financing, developing, and incentivizing metaverse citizens, especially at a time when virtual worlds are struggling to convince the public of a compelling case for their existence. In this study, we review existing research on financial applications within the metaverse, including virtual financial services, instruments, intermediaries, and markets.

We find further evidence that this relationship is heterogeneous. Both state-owned and smaller banks, as measured by market capitalisation, are found to have presented a weaker response to Fintech development.

Although zakat institutions in Malaysia use technology, confidence in the efficiency of the zakat fund is still an ongoing issue. Therefore, the potential of blockchain technology for improving the zakat management system is examined. Design/Methodology/Approach — An exploratory study involving two informants with expertise in blockchain technology and Islamic finance was conducted to investigate how the application of blockchain in the zakat management system will accelerate the future implementation and potential of zakat management in Malaysia. Findings — This research finds an accord between the features of blockchain technology and the objectives of zakat. The features are transparency, traceability and security, which align closely with the goals of zakat. As such, a new model has been proposed for the zakat management system, one empowered by blockchain technology that harmonises with the existing system and enhances these elements. Originality/Value — This research can motivate zakat institutions in Malaysia to implement blockchain technology in their zakat management systems by using the proposed model. The research shows the synchronisation of blockchain principles with zakat, which would build trust and confidence. Practical Implications — The discussion on how blockchain can be embedded in the existing zakat management system will contribute towards enhancing zakat management in Malaysia and improve the performance of zakat institutions, enabling them to better serve the community. Given the scarce literature on blockchain adoption in zakat management, this study can spur further research and discussion within this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain technology; Fintech; Islamic social finance; Zakat blockchain; Zakat management system","","","","This study is funded by the Ministry of Higher Education in Malaysia through the award of the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS): FRGS/1/2021/SS01/UKM/02/2.

The theoretical argument that has been developed thus far is that the fatwa is the most appropriate legal tool for Muslim communities to respond to the rapid development of digital business. Nevertheless, do the existing fatwas fulfill legal needs as expected in this era of digital transactions? Hence, this paper discusses digital transaction fatwas within the framework of Islamic legal epistemology, especially fatwas from the National Shariah Council– Indonesian Ulama Council. The research method uses normative juridical with a conceptual and historical-usuliyah approach. This research finds that the contemporary fatwa epistemology of the National Shariah Council–Indonesian Ulama Council in terms of digital transactions employs istislahi arguments. This is shown by the proposition that fiqh rules are more dominant than textual ones. Moreover, the arguments in the fatwa of the National Shariah Council–Indonesian Ulama Council provide signs of benefit as the estuary of maqasid syari’ah. The consistency of the use of legal methodology utilized by the National Shariah Council–Indonesian Ulama Council in fatwas on digital transactions is shown in the structure and utilization of al-nusus al-shariah arguments, the opinions of ulama, and the rules of fiqh, which are expanded from the five rules of fiqh into eight rules. These fatwas are reliable and valid in terms of dictum and method, thus supporting the development of the current digital transactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Transaction; Fatwa; Islamic Law Epistemology","","","","","Outlines of Muhammadan Law, (1974); Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Dynamic effect of Bitcoin, fintech and artificial intelligence stocks on eco-friendly assets, Islamic stocks and conventional financial markets: Another look using quantile-based approaches, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 192, (2023); Nukhbatul Ulum, (2016); Tahdis Jurnal Kajian Ilmu Al Hadis, (2022); Fatwa Fatwa Ekonomi Syariah, (2025); F Fatw Al Imm Al Shtib; Akbar, Yusaf H., The digital economy and the growth dynamics of sharing platforms: A transaction cost economics assessment, Journal of Digital Economy, 1, 3, pp. 209-226, (2022); Al-Zaman, Md Sayeed, Social mediatization of religion: islamic videos on YouTube, Heliyon, 8, 3, (2022); Usul Al Fiqh Al Islami; Alfarizi, Muhammad, Adoption Of Cash on Delivery (COD) Payment System in Shopee Marketplace Transaction, Procedia Computer Science, 227, pp. 110-118, (2023)","","Faculty of Sharia, Universitas Islam Negeri K.H.

The study used a qualitative approach to accomplish the research objectives. Semi-structured interviews with regulators, legal councils and investors were conducted to gain in-depth and practical knowledge concerning the connection among digital currencies, money laundering and customer protection. According to the study, Malaysia has positive intentions towards digital currencies concerning protection through robust legislation. However, current practices and laws enacted by the government and regulators are contradictory. It has resulted in confusion among the public concerning adopting or rejecting such currencies. Further, this confusion provided opportunities for scammers and caused the trapping of innocent investors by scammers. These loopholes and contradictions among different legislations offer a favourable environment for criminals, especially money launderers, to exploit the Malaysian digital currencies regime.

However, most state-of-the-art cryptocurrency valuation methods only focus on one of the fundamental factors or sentiments and use out-of-date data sources. In this study, a robust cryptocurrency valuation method is developed using up-to-date datasets. Using various panel regression models and moving-window regression tests, the impacts of fundamental factors and sentiments in the valuation of cryptocurrencies are explored with data covering from January 1, 2009 to April 30, 2023. The research shows the importance of sentiments and suggests that the fear and greed index can indicate when to make a cryptocurrency investment, while Google search interest in cryptocurrency is crucial when choosing the appropriate type of cryptocurrency. Moreover, consensus mechanism and initial coin offering have significant effects on cryptocurrencies without stablecoins, while their impacts on cryptocurrencies with stablecoins are insignificant.

This paper aims to empirically re-examine the effects of the governance components on Islamic finance in 45 Islamic finance-permitting countries. The study utilizes the dynamic panel GMM approach from the data spanning from 2012 to 2019. We find insignificant effect of regulation in Islamic finance in the region of developed countries, Muslim minority countries, and other Arab countries. We also find that corporate governance is not statistically significant in MENA and non-Asian countries. These results reinforce the need for a new type of regulation based on product requirements, policies, and procedures.

The article evaluates, despite a scarcity of data, the effects on e-commerce development of the ubiquitous lockdowns and restriction measures introduced by most countries during the pandemic period. The analysis covers monthly data from January 1996 to February 2021. The research paper analyzes relative changes in the original time series through the autocorrelation function. The objects of this analysis are Amazon and Alibaba, as they are benchmarks in the e-commerce industry. This paper tests the shock effect on the e-commerce companies Alibaba in China and Amazon in the USA, concluding that it is weaker for companies with small market capitalizations. As a result, the effect on estimated e-trade volume in the USA was approximately 35% in 2020. Another evaluation considers fuzzy decision-making methodology. For this purpose, balanced scorecard-based open financial innovation models for the e-commerce industry are weighted with multistepwise weight assessment ratio analysis based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets and the golden cut. Within this framework, a detailed analysis of competitors should be made. The paper proves that this situation positively affects the development of successful financial innovation models for the e-commerce industry. Therefore, it may be possible to attract greater attention from e-commerce companies for these financial innovation products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","E-commerce; Golden cut; Open innovation; Sustainable trade","","","","Nikita Moiseev performed the study in the framework of the state task in the field of scientific activity of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, project “Development of the methodology and a software platform for the construction of digital twins, intellectual analysis and forecast of complex economic systems”, grant no.

The halal status of food must be traced from the process of raw materials, processing, packaging, transportation, and distribution to the final consumer. It is difficult to trace the certainty of halal food, especially beef in Medan City because the supply chain information from upstream to downstream is not transparent. To increase the transparency of beef status and increase consumer confidence, especially Muslim consumers, a distributed and transparent system is needed, where many parties can access the status of food at any time. So Blockchain technology is used to help track the halal status of beef along the supply chain. The purpose of this study is to design a system to obtain information certainty that beef distributed along the supply chain is halal and safe for consumption by utilizing Blockchain technology and to increase public safety and trust in the LPPOM MUI halal certification system. Based on the discussion and research analysis, it is known that the information in the halal beef supply chain in Medan City uses blockchain technology designed with a data security system using smart contracts, where information that has been stored cannot be changed by any party. so that there is a guarantee of information security in the beef supply chain in the city of Medan.

Within the banking sector, Islamic banks assume a significant role in advocating ethical and socially responsible conduct. This study delves into the impact of the board of directors' characteristics on corporate social responsibility disclosures (CSRD) within Jordanian Islamic banks. Data were meticulously gathered from three Jordanian Islamic banks, all of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), over the span of the years 2010 to 2022. Our findings illuminate that Jordanian Islamic banks, on average, disclose 47 percent of their CSR endeavors, marking a commendable level of transparency, particularly when contrasted with less developed economies. Notably, independent directors comprise 42% of the board composition, with the average age of board members standing at 41 years. Moreover, 8.10% of board members hold degrees in finance and accounting, while 0.24% possess professional experience within the Big Four accounting firms. On average, Jordanian Islamic banks convene 10.27 board meetings annually, and 48% of directors maintain multiple directorships. Significantly, our analysis underscores that all examined characteristics of board members have a favorable influence on CSR disclosure within Jordanian Islamic banks. This paper constitutes a substantial contribution to the extant literature by providing empirical substantiation of the nexus between the board of directors' characteristics and CSRD in Jordanian Islamic banks, with a specific emphasis on the unique domain of Islamic banking, which has hitherto received limited scholarly attention. Further avenues of research are recommended to explore additional variables and delve deeper into the intricate interplay between board characteristics, external contextual factors, and the disclosure of CSR activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board of directors; Corporate social responsibility; disclosures; Ethical practices; Islamic banks; Jordanian banking sector; Transparency","","","","","Journal of Modern Accounting and Auditing, (2017); Aksenov, Gleb, Development of Trade and Financial-Economical Relationships between China and Russia: A Study Based on the Trade Gravity Model, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 7, (2023); Alawaqleh, Qasim Ahmad, The Effect of Board of Directors and CEO on Audit Quality: Evidence from Listed Manufacturing Firms in Jordan, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 2, pp. 243-253, (2021); Alfraih, Mishari M., Voluntary disclosure and corporate governance: empirical evidence from Kuwait, International Journal of Law and Management, 59, 2, pp. 217-236, (2017); AlQudah, Alaa Mohammad, The role of ownership map in constraining discretionary loan loss-provisions decisions in Jordanian banks, Cogent Business and Management, 7, 1, (2020); Alrabba, Hussein Mohammed, The mediating role of foreign ownership in the relationship between board characteristics and voluntary disclosures of Jordanian banks, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, 22, 6, (2018); International Journal of Management and Applied Science, (2018); Al-Zaqeba, Murad Ali Ahmad, Extension of the TPB in tax compliance behavior: The role of moral intensity and customs tax, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 4, pp. 227-232, (2020); Al-Zaqeba, Murad Ali Ahmad, The effect of management accounting and blockchain technology characteristics on supply chains efficiency, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 10, 3, pp. 973-982, (2022); Alzaqebah, Malek, Hybrid feature selection method based on particle swarm optimization and adaptive local search method, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 2414-2422, (2021)","","Institute of Advanced Science Extension (IASE)","","","","","","2313626X; 23133724","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182372436"

The underlying ethos of AI is to create a secure ecosystem for every human endeavour. Investors are claiming that the invention of an AI assistant such as a robot maid is the future reality. The AI robot is unstoppable and will obstruct how things are done at home. The development of AI and the demand for it indicates a future challenge to domestic activities. Since technology is replacing human efforts, scholars and researchers are concerned about the permissibility of Islamic banks to finance AI projects for the development of robot-maid. A robot maid is likely to exploit gender issues simply because consumers might prefer an AI maid that is male or female. Social violation in the use of AI maid will likely trigger further queries. This study uses the doctrinal approach of the qualitative method to explore Islamic thresholds and analyzes the juristic consideration for financing the development of AI for human development. The study explains the understanding of AI, its contributions to the world economy, and some pertinent issues and challenges.

The accuracy of financial reporting and the ability of the Nigerian banks to fully digitalize their services are both severely limited by infrastructure deficiencies and unstable power supplies. The goal of this study is to fill in the gaps in the existing literature on the significance of digital disruption of accounting information in DMBs in Nigeria's developing banking industry. The study employed a field survey research design and data were sourced with the help of self-structured questionnaires. The respondents were drawn from the staff of 13 DMBs listed in Nigeria. A total of 641 questionnaires were retrieved and validated for the study. The reliability and validity of the study instruments were confirmed with the help of the Cronbach alpha test with a range of 0.877 to 0.967 which suggested satisfactory reliability of the measures and further suggested that all the measurement scales of the instrument were good enough. The results showed that the mean values for each category ranged from 3.83 to 4.53 with an overall mean of 4.13. The regression showed that DDAI had a significant effect on qualitative characteristics. The study concluded that DDAI had a significant effect on the quality of the financial reporting of listed DMBs in Nigeria. The outcome significantly contributes to the idea that managers of DMBs should consider the digitalization of the accounting information process to improve the quality of financial reporting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Blockchain; Cloud accounting; Digital disruption","","","","","Abbas, Alhamzah Fadhil, The Blockchain Technologies in Healthcare: Prospects, Obstacles, and Future Recommendations; Lessons Learned from Digitalization, International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 18, 9, pp. 144-159, (2022); Review of Financial Studies, (1988); Adugna, Birhan Moges, Determinants of internet financial reporting: In the case of Ethiopian insurance and banking sector companies, Innovations, 66, pp. 760-778, (2021); Abu Afifa, Malik Muneer, Blockchain adoption in accounting by an extended UTAUT model: empirical evidence from an emerging economy, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 21, 1, pp. 5-44, (2023); Augustine University Journal of Social Sciences, (2021); International Journal of Accounting and Financial Reporting, (2013); Ahmed, Ibrahim Elsiddig, The qualitative characteristics of accounting information, earnings quality, and islamic banking performance: evidence from the gulf banking sector, International Journal of Financial Studies, 8, 2, pp. 1-16, (2020); International Journal of Social Science and Economic Research, (2017); European Journal of Accounting Auditing and Finance Research, (2020); European Journal of Accounting Auditing and Finance Research, (2019)","","Online Academic Press","","","","","","2577767X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178305495"

The study's population included 210 service-based enterprises located in Jordan. The research used a sample size of 136 respondents from registered service-based enterprises in Jordan. The researchers used a structured questionnaire to gather data from the participants. The data acquired in this study were evaluated using a combination of basic percentage calculations and Pearson product moment analysis. The research has reached the conclusion that the lending activities of Fintech firms have a noteworthy impact on the expansion of service-based companies in Jordan. The study suggests that it would be advantageous for the Fintech service provider to engage in advertising efforts aimed at promoting their services, with the goal of increasing the adoption of their mobile money product among a wider range of business professionals. This would lead to an increased number of entrepreneurs using Fintech as a means to augment the expansion of their businesses. The scope of the research was limited to a small number of service-based organizations. However, it is important to include other service-based companies that were not included in this study. To get a comprehensive understanding, a comparison study should be conducted to explore other characteristics that were not addressed in the current research.

This phenomenon has generated a significant number of digital assets left behind after the demise of their owners. This paper provides a legal analysis of the implications of abandoned digital assets in Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms. It seeks answers to two central research questions: what are the Sharīʿah and legal implications of digital assets after the passing of the owner? How can the existing Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms prevent uncertainty over digital assets? Design/Methodology/Approach — This is a conceptual paper which adopts a qualitative analysis of both primary and secondary sources from existing journals and regulatory instruments in Islamic finance jurisdictions to explore the gaps in the law regarding digital assets and regulations regarding unclaimed money. The paper further compares the approaches adopted in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia in regulating digital assets and unclaimed moneys. Findings — The paper finds that there is scope for the administration of digital assets in both regulated and unregulated Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms. Similarly, the adoption of e-KYC that complies with the Sharīʿah ethos is essential to ensure that digital assets are not lost upon the account holder’s demise. The legal right and title of the account holder and legal heirs can only be protected through the operation of digital assets regulation in a Sharīʿah-compliant fintech environment. Originality — This paper is of value to administrators and legal heirs of account holders in fintech environments. It recommends measures to prevent intestacy and uphold the account holders’ and legal heirs’ intergenerational property rights and financial benefits. Research Limitations/Implications — As a conceptual paper, the attitude of digital asset users is not examined due to the absence of quantitative or qualitative data on devolution of digital assets. Practical Implications — Although this study focuses on the implication of digital assets for Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms, the findings may well have a bearing on policymakers, legal practitioners, and administrators of estates in the management of emerging asset classes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital assets; Fintech; Securities; Sharīʿah; Unclaimed money","","","","","Abiteboul, Serge, Viewpoint : Managing your digital life, Communications of the ACM, 58, 5, pp. 32-35, (2015); Islamic Culture Al Thaqfat Al Islmiyyah Research Journal, (2010); Sjd Thesis Unclaimed Money in Saudi Banks, (2016); Ante, Lennart, The impact of transparent money flows: Effects of stablecoin transfers on the returns and trading volume of Bitcoin, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 170, (2021); International Conference on Sociality and Economics Development Ipedr, (2011); Academic Journal of Business Administration Law and Social Sciences, (2015); Understanding Islamic Law, (2011); Prob Prop Heinonline, (2015); Sahih Bukhari, (1956); Does My Digital Estate Belong to Me Estate Planning for Digital Assets, (2013)","","International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA)","","","","","","22894365; 01281976","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165695422"

The primary distinction between conventional and Islamic finance is that Sharia law explicitly forbids several of the activities and principles applied in conventional banking. According to Sharia law, “Paying or charging an interest (Riba)” lending with interest payments as an exploitative practice that benefits the lender at the expense of the borrower, “investing in businesses engaged in banned activities"" like producing and selling alcohol or pork, “speculation or gambling(Maisir)” That means financial institutions are prohibited from participating in contracts where the ownership of goods depends on an unpredictable future event, and Participation in contracts with a high level of risk or uncertainty is referred to as ""uncertainty and risk (Gharar)"", which are strictly prohibited. As a result, consumers must be aware of whether they are taking Riba, Gharar, Maisir or if their money is invested in a halal firm. Because of its qualities, blockchain would be useful in this situation. This research tries to determine how blockchain technology can be used to make investments and profit or loss returns more transparent, more secure, Immutable and sharia compliant.

This study argues that disaster risk management (DRM) is an essential approach to mitigate the impact of global calamities, such as a pandemic. However, due to the uncertainty emerging from variables such as time and demand, managing DRM effectively involves high complexity. Blockchain technology (BcT) can be implemented to help address these challenges due to its potential to build trust, transparency, and accountability in complex operations. However, no research has quantitatively examined the applicability of BcT in the sub-dimensions of DRM to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal and scope of this study is to explore the role of BcT in DRM operations during the COVID-19 pandemic through an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (IF-MCDM) framework. More specifically, the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (IF-ANP) method was utilized to calculate the weights of key criteria (i.e., BcT benefits), while Intuitionistic Fuzzy VIKOR (IF-VIKOR) was used to prioritize the alternatives (i.e., the sub-dimensions of DRM). The findings of this study are threefold. First, supporting effective coordination turned out to be the most essential benefit of BcT to build resilience in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, disaster management was found to be the most appropriate DRM sub-dimension for possible BcT implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, eleven distinct activities involved in disaster management and governance and financial protection were discovered to be the most applicable for BcT. The findings of this study could assist disaster risk managers to assess whether (or not) BcT is suitable for the sub-dimensions of DRM to build national and organizational resilience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain technology; Disaster risk management; Intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision making; The COVID-19","","","","","Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A., Blockchain technologies to mitigate COVID-19 challenges: A scoping review, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine Update, 1, (2021); Abdullah, Mohd Lazim, Sustainable energy planning decision using the intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process: choosing energy technology in Malaysia, International Journal of Sustainable Energy, 35, 4, pp. 360-377, (2016); Abid, Amal, NovidChain: Blockchain-based privacy-preserving platform for COVID-19 test/vaccine certificates, Software - Practice and Experience, 52, 4, pp. 841-867, (2022); Ahmed, Wafaa A.H., Blockchain in the supply chain – A comprehensive framework for theory-driven research, Digital Business, 2, 2, (2022); Aitzhan, Nurzhan Zhumabekuly, Security and Privacy in Decentralized Energy Trading Through Multi-Signatures, Blockchain and Anonymous Messaging Streams, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 15, 5, pp. 840-852, (2018); AlShamsi, Mohammed, Artificial intelligence and blockchain for transparency in governance, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 912, pp. 219-230, (2021); Ar, Ilker Murat, Evaluating the feasibility of blockchain in logistics operations: A decision framework, Expert Systems with Applications, 158, (2020); Asadzadeh, Afsoon, Information technology in emergency management of COVID-19 outbreak, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 21, (2020); Atanassov, Krassimir T., Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 20, 1, pp. 87-96, (1986); undefined, (2008)","","Springer","","","","","","19369743; 19369735","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145231259"

This study aimed to analyze the influence of the digital economy, financial literacy, human capital, the role of Islamic financial institutions, government support for strengthening the Islamic economy and the Islamic financial performance of SMEs in Makassar City, Indonesia. This study used a quantitative method with a survey approach. Data were obtained through questionnaires distributed to 350 respondents with a sampling method. The results of this study indicated that the strengthening of the sharia economy, the Islamic financial performance of SMEs, economic digitalization and financial literacy are determined by factors of human capital, the role of Islamic financial institutions and government support. Regarding human capital, the roles of Islamic financial institutions and government support affect the Islamic financial performance of SMEs with a coefficient of determination of 58.5%. Human capital, the role of Islamic financial institutions, government support and financial performance have a positive correlation with the strengthening of the sharia economy with a coefficient of determination of 71.6%.

This concept is a model of empowering economic digitalization within the scope of government to provide facilities and the synchronization of all stakeholders throughout the archipelago (). In addition, the ease of the financial use of technology as part of economic digitalization can provide flexibility in SME financial transactions that enable the development of an efficient and effective business order. Various circumstances influence SMES in adopting Islamic economic digitalization such as knowledge about Islamic economy, perceptions, expectations, social responsibility aspects, facilities and Islamic values. The business continuity of Islamic SMEs is strongly supported by the adoption of Islamic fintech and financial literacy (; ; ). Some attributes can be attached to digital economics, such as digitalization, namely business transactions using information and technology devices; virtualization, namely changing business mechanisms from physical goods to virtual goods; molecularization, namely the status of heavy organizations changing into light organizations that are more flexible; internetworking, which can help in building interconnections and forming economic networks; disintermediation, i.e., eliminated peer-to-peer ().","Abbass, Kashif, Fresh Insight through a Keynesian Theory Approach to Investigate the Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 3, (2022); Abdallah, Ali, Has the Lack of a Unified Halal Standard Led to a Rise in Organised Crime in the Halal Certification Sector?, Forensic Sciences, 1, 3, pp. 181-193, (2021); Akben Selcuk, Elif, Corporate social responsibility and financial performance: The moderating role of ownership concentration in Turkey, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 13, (2019); Alamsyah, Andry, Blockchain-Based Traceability System to Support the Indonesian Halal Supply Chain Ecosystem, Economies, 10, 6, (2022); Albaity, Mohamed Shikh Abubaker, Bank Stock Return Reactions to the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Investor Sentiment in MENA Countries, Risks, 10, 2, (2022); Alhammadi, Salah, Analyzing the Role of Islamic Finance in Kuwait Regarding Sustainable Economic Development in COVID-19 Era, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2022); Growing Indonesias Sharia Economy Requires Focus on Four Energy Pillars, (2021); Arner, Douglas W., Sustainability, FinTech and Financial Inclusion, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 1, pp. 7-35, (2020); Azevedo, Americo Lopes, Grasp the challenge of digital transition in smes—a training course geared towards decision-makers, Education Sciences, 11, 4, (2021); Bahrini, Raéf, Impact of information and communication technology on economic growth: Evidence from developing countries, Economies, 7, 1, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277099","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153759660"

However, empirical research examining the effect of FinTech on green finance remains underexplored. In light of the advantageous position of green credit in the development of green finance in China, this study analyzes the impact of FinTech on green credit development using polluting listed firms in 2012–2021. The results show that FinTech significantly improves the development of green credit, affecting it through two crucial mechanisms: information asymmetry and green credit allocation efficiency. Additionally, heterogeneity analysis reveals that FinTech has a more significant impact on regions with higher government environmental objectives, small-to-medium enterprises with low carbon emissions, and firms with high external ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) scores. Overall, our findings indicate that financial institutions should be committed to leveraging FinTech for the pre-loan investigation of green credit, and policymakers should encourage the development of FinTech in order to perfect environmental information disclosure policies to establish environmental information-sharing platforms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FinTech; green credit; green credit allocation efficiency; information asymmetry","asymmetry; carbon emission; credit provision; financial system; heterogeneity; policy making; small and medium-sized enterprise; China","","","This paper gratefully acknowledges financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China “impact assessment and mechanism of digital finance on residents’ consumption inequality” (No. 21CJY045).","Wang, Chunyang, Pollution and corporate valuation: evidence from China, Applied Economics, 51, 32, pp. 3516-3530, (2019); Liu, Li, Output and welfare effect of green credit in China: Evidence from an estimated DSGE model, Journal of Cleaner Production, 294, (2021); Wen, Huwei, Green credit policy, credit allocation efficiency and upgrade of energy-intensive enterprises, Energy Economics, 94, (2021); Muganyi, Tadiwanashe, Green finance, fintech and environmental protection: Evidence from China, Environmental Science and Ecotechnology, 7, (2021); Swain, Srishti, ABCD technology-AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing and Data security in Islamic banking sector∗, pp. 58-62, (2022); Fintech Credit Market Structure Business Models and Financial Stability Implications, (2017); Fuster, Andreas, The Role of Technology in Mortgage Lending, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1854-1899, (2019); Peng, Zhikai, Spillover Effect of the Interaction between Fintech and the Real Economy Based on Tail Risk Dependent Structure Analysis, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 13, (2022); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Zhou, Guangyou, The impact of fintech innovation on green growth in China: Mediating effect of green finance, Ecological Economics, 193, (2022)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152692075"

Particularly, in Islamic finance environment it could not attract significant attention from the researchers, academicians, and practitioners. Though, some studies have discussed the tools of Islamic social finance, however, the focus on developing a practicable conceptual framework remained least attentive in recent studies. This study aims to fill this gap and attract the attention of all stakeholders to augment the Islamic Social finance theory and provide grounds for practitioners and academicians to implement technological tools to enhance its social impact. This study uses a qualitative library research approach to develop the spectrum of Islamic social finance and identify the issues faced by the key players within the spectrum. Likewise, technological advancement in the form of crowdfunding is exclusively proposed for the Islamic social finance spectrum in order to overcome all related issues and meet the objectives of SharÊ'ah i.e., MaqÉÎid al SharÊ'ah which are embedded in its CSR values.

One such belief system is the Sharī‘a Law, which governs the financial practices of Muslims, worldwide. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity, it is essential to understand their compatibility with the Sharī‘a Law and resolve any resulting ethical dilemmas. The fundamental issue is whether cryptocurrencies violate the principles of Sharī‘a or can be considered a permissible investment option for Muslims. The article provides a detailed overview about digital currencies. It also explores the different types of digital currencies and their underlying technologies, such as block chain and smart contracts. This research relies on a quantitative approach, utilizing a systematic review of articles By extracting and analyzing data from scholarly works, the study aims to quantify the existing discourse on the compatibility of cryptocurrencies with Sharī‘a Law. This method enables the synthesis of quantitative insights from authoritative sources, contributing to a robust understanding of the ethical implications and adherence to Sharī‘a principles in the context of cryptocurrency use. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","block chain; comparative analysis; cryptocurrencies; digital advancement; Sharī‘a law","","","","","undefined, (2021); Blockchain A Graph Primer, (2017); Alfar, Abdelrahman J.K., The determinants of issuing central bank digital currencies, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023); Institute of Scientific Communications Conference, (2020); undefined; Castrén, Olli, Digital currencies in financial networks, Journal of Financial Stability, 60, (2022); Glyn Davies A History of Money from Ancient Times to the Present Day, (1994); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Ijief, (2020); Hoang, Yen Hai, Central bank digital currency: A systematic literature review using text mining approach, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023); Trkh Al Nuqd Al Islmiyyah, (1988)","","University of Management and Technology","","","","","","20750943; 25200313","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192069787"

The critique focuses on three aspects of the ban. The first is criticism for banning cryptocurrency which is considered to contain garar and ḍarār, and is contrary to Law No. 7 of 2011 and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 17 of 2015. The second is criticism of the illegality of buying/selling cryptocurrency, which is positioned as a digital asset/commodity that contains garar, ḍarār, qimār, and does not meet the sil’ah criteria. The third is criticism of the permissibility of cryptocurrency as a commodity/asset when it fulfills the sil’aḥ criteria and has underlying and clear legal benefits to be traded. This study adopted a qualitative approach. The conclusion reveals that MUI's fatwā on cryptocurrencies was not built on solid legal reasoning and did not consider the benefits of technological advances. The MUI's fatwā is based on the principles of Islamic law, specifically garar, ḍarār, and qimār, which are used to evaluate the legality of trading commodities or digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to note that the MUI's fatwā does not consider the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as their use as a new form of investment and their potential to revolutionize industries by enhancing security, and efficiency, and creating new trading opportunities in the digital age. In terms of non-Sharia technology, it is seen as a tool that can be used for good or evil, and its permissibility depends on its use. Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, is considered acceptable because it makes transactions more secure and enables the use of smart contracts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Islamic law; MUI’s Fatwā","","","","We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the individuals and institutions who made this research possible.

One of the needs for financial digitalization in the study of Islamic contracts and Islamic business law is the use of digital platforms with digital currencies. Regarding the merits and downsides of its Sharia restrictions and its halal certification, which is currently under discussion, digital currencies and perks have generated controversy in Jordan and other Islamic countries. Methods: This study intends to analyze the legal foundations of digital currency from Jordanian and Islamic legal perspectives. The descriptive-qualitative research approach was utilized, and data collection processes included documentation and a literature review. All legal possibilities that may be drawn from Islamic law in order to investigate the legality of digital currencies are explored further and used to obtain the conclusions of this study. Results: A review of Sharia reasons and consideration for the wellbeing of the people suggests that digital currencies in their current form are incompatible with it and must adhere to the stipulations of Islamic finance. Therefore, digital currencies are unsuitable as a store of value or wealth due to their erratic swings, lack of purchasing power, and instant responsiveness to any technical problem, technical penetration, or official circumstance. Due to market instability, digital currencies can't be utilized to defer payments, settle debts, or repay loans. Conclusions: Digital currencies are speculative; not real money. Most of those who have this money are speculators seeking a quick payoff. Sharia views digital currency trading as gambling due to its high degree of volatility. Jordan's government should regulate digital currency use to meet demand. Digital currencies must be addressed under e-commerce laws. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; Digital Currencies; Digital Representation; Functions of Money; Jordan Law; The Physical Presence of Currency","article; cryptocurrency; documentation; electronic commerce; finance; gambling; government; human; Jordan; law; peer review; purchasing power; qualitative research; wellbeing","","","Authors would like to thank Jadara and Yarmouk Universities for their support and facilitation.","Crypto 82, (1982); Kethineni, Sesha R., The Rise in Popularity of Cryptocurrency and Associated Criminal Activity, International Criminal Justice Review, 30, 3, pp. 325-344, (2020); Yelowitz, Aaron S., Characteristics of Bitcoin users: an analysis of Google search data, Applied Economics Letters, 22, 13, pp. 1030-1036, (2015); Cpa Journal, (2017); Legal Status of Online Currencies are Bitcoins the Future Melbourne Business School, (2016); See the Circular Issued by the Central Bank of Jordan Regarding Cryptocurrencies, (2020); Tiered Cbdc and the Financial System, (2020); Financial Technology Future Trends in Financial Business, (2016); Monetary Plurality in Local Regional and Global Economies, (2019); Tafhim Ikim Journal of Islam and the Contemporary World, (2022)","","F1000 Research Ltd","","","","","","20461402","","","37868298","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181782774"

The study used normative legal research methods. This research approach used a conceptual approach through reasoning the concepts of sustainable financing, green sukuk, and other concepts relevant to the topic of study to strengthen the discussion argument. The study showed that there are 2 (two) components of the relevance of the Sustainable Financing paradigm as the basis for implementing green sukuk in Indonesia. First, the implementation of green sukuk in various countries has rules that accommodate sustainable financing in response to climate change problems. Second, the sustainable financing Paradigm is relevant as a source of green sukuk legal construction to strengthen the policy basis for implementing environmentally sound investment in Indonesia.

First, these sukuk effectively combat pressing environmental issues and play a pivotal role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,33 aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Furthermore, they serve as a means to finance renewable energy initiatives and other environmentally friendly projects, thus contributing significantly to sustainable development goals.34 An important facet of green sukuk lies in their ability to attract a broader investor base, particularly those interested in supporting sustainable and responsible investments, thereby enlarging the pool of funding available for eco-friendly initiatives. This increased investment not only expands the market's scope but also offers issuers access to new avenues for financial support, enhancing the overall reach and impact of these instruments. Additionally, green sukuk proves instrumental for countries facing financial deficits in pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), acting as a viable financial solution for funding gaps. One of their key features involves the assurance of transparency and accountability through regular sustainability reporting, ensuring that the raised funds are used for the intended environmental and social projects. Finally, by directing capital towards projects with clear environmental and social benefits, green sukuk significantly contributes to sustainable development efforts on a global scale.","Abdullah, Mohammad Syafiq, What drives green sukuk?

Many of the halal food in those countries are supplied by SMEs. Although the importance of this sector is certain, studies investigating the organizational aspect of halal food SMEs are still limited. The present study tries to expand the knowledge of organizational behaviour aspects in halal food SMEs since it is crucial in creating the sustainability of halal food SMEs. The present study uses partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The questions used to measure the variables used in this study were developed by adopting previous studies’ instruments. This research discovered the importance of IT capability and organizational learning on organizational performance. IT capability, Knowledge transfer effectiveness, and Absorptive capacity are found to have a significant relationship with organizational performance measured by Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Furthermore, the effect of IT capability and Knowledge transfer effectiveness are not only direct but also mediated by Absorptive capacity. From the findings, there are key implications. First, by utilizing digital capabilities in their business processes, SMEs can more easily obtain new knowledge. Second, when SMEs learn new things from digitalization, they can associate their knowledge with new information. Third, the ability to use technology helps human resources in SMEs to increase knowledge, thus encouraging SMEs to create innovation and business competitiveness. This ultimately has an impact on increasing sales and cost-effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","absorptive capacity; IT capability; knowledge transfer effectiveness; organizational learning; organizational performance; Smes","","","","This work is part of the research entitled “The Effect of IT Capability Through Organizational Learning Processes on the Performance of Halal Food SME in Indonesia during the Post COVID-19 Economic Recovery Period,” funded by Research Grant Bank Indonesia 2022 with grant number 24/4/PKS/BINS/2022.

The current study aims to predict the behavioural intention of Jordanian healthcare professionals to use blockchain-based electronic health record systems. Furthermore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which perceived privacy and perceived security influence healthcare professionals’ behavioural intention to use blockchain technology in Jordan. This study proposed perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust as mediators. The quantitative approach was used to collect data from 389 Jordanian healthcare professionals working in the public sector via crosssectional surveys. The data was analysed with Smart-PLS and IBM-SPSS. Except for the influence of perceived security on perceived usefulness, all of the supposed relationships were supported in this study. Furthermore, all suggested mediating relationships were supported, with the exception of the mediation role of perceived usefulness between the influence of perceived security on behavioural intention.

For the protection of cyberspace from hackers and other harmful people, biometric security is growing more and more popular among organizations, individuals and enterprises. The word 'cyber security' refers to the procedures, techniques, and tools used to safeguard data, network system, computer networks and software from potential attacks online. Online financial service delivery is referred to as 'cyber banking.' As the trend of exchanging things has changed, internet banking has grown. Despite the benefits, there have been instances of security threat-related issues with Internet banking. To identify persons, biometric security verifies their physical attributes and behavioral traits. For identification verification, it is the most reliable and effective physical security method. According to biometric authentication, people can be recognized precisely based on their innate behavioral or physical traits. Numerous security measures have been implemented throughout the entire Internet banking service to address these issues. Globally, cybercrime has deep roots and poses a significant threat to the occurrence of criminal or terrorist behavior. Without being addressed by a single authority, these risks can compromise security on the inside as well as the outside. If the cybercrime goes unnoticed, both money and personal data are lost. Internet services and information infrastructure have previously been targeted in assaults. Online fraud and hacker attacks are only two examples of the daily computer-related crimes that take place. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most reliable foundation for facilitating high-quality, comfortable human living. IoT has had a substantial impact across a range of application domains. Smart gadgets are more vulnerable to hackers because of their rapid development and trust in wireless mechanics for data transport. As a result, the rate of cybercrime is rising daily. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity emerges because of technological advancement and poses a risk to public safety, personal property rights, and privacy protection for people. The study elaborates on the key features of biometrics system in conventional and Islamic banking to counter the risk of cybersecurity and provide high safety and security to the banking industry.

Recently, digital crowdfunding has been considered a new unique tool for pooling funds through online platforms. This modern fundraising technique has successfully supported business activities and community-based projects. This concept can be utilized to support the current student entrepreneurship programs at universities, where it was reported that these institutions had experienced a limitation in terms of budget. Over the period, students at higher education institutions have witnessed challenges and difficulties in surviving their learning journey, particularly in terms of financial capability. Entrepreneurship is believed to be able to help students discover an additional income during their studies. Based on the interview, it was found that crowdfunding should be promoted to support small entrepreneurs, including students. However, proper models are needed to ensure crowdfunding is not misused and its efficiency and applicability. Regarding student entrepreneurship programs, Waqf and Infaq can be applied as crowdfunding models. The outcome of this paper would benefit many parties, including student entrepreneurs, crowdfunding platforms, universities, and society. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Infaq; Islamic crowdfunding; Student entrepreneurship; Waqf","","","","Funding: This research is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia fully under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Grant number: FRGS/1/2022/SS01/UNISZA/02/1).

This study compared legal regulations in the United States that analysed the readiness of regulations and Indonesia's legal loopholes in responding to the development of the cryptocurrency business. As a result, cryptocurrency in Indonesia is susceptible to being used as a money-laundering tool due to the novelty of the technology, the anonymity it provides its users, and the immaturity of the regulations governing it. Therefore, it is necessary to create a cryptocurrency that can follow the “Travel Rule” and collect and share information about the people who send and receive cryptocurrency, like in the US. The study also argues that passive detection is used to detect the identity of cryptocurrency users through a centralised service.

Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness distribution process and lack of transparency in the zakat management are commonly cited as key impediments (bin Khatiman et al., 2021). Blockchain is expected to solve these issues due to its ability to record and trace every transaction, allowing administrators to discharge their accountability to zakat stakeholders. Thus, this study intended to develop a zakat collection blockchain system with the aim to provide economical and integrated continuous real-time zakat transactions, transparency and traceability by developing smart contracts in zakat management. The study employed four stages of process based on waterfall model starting from the interview session and analyse of the standard operating procedure (SOP) on zakat collection in the Zakat Collection Centre or Pusat Pungutan Zakat-Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (PPZ-MAIWP). Then, design requirement specification (DRS) is employed after being reviewed and approved by PPZ-MAIWP. The results show that the development of blockchain in the zakat collection system could be eradicating extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity among the community in the country. The study contributes through a transparent and reliable environment for exchanging data and carrying out transactions through a decentralized digital ledger technology to record anything of value and as a result able to ensure transparency, reliability, trust ability and traceability of the zakat transactions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Fintech; Islamic Finance; Malaysia; Smart Contract; Zakat","","","","","Ab Rahman, Azman, Zakat institution in Malaysia: Problems and issues, Global Journal Al-Thaqafah, 2, 1, pp. 35-41, (2012); Abaidoo, Rexford, Financial development and institutional quality among emerging economies, Journal of Economics and Development, 24, 3, pp. 198-216, (2022); International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology, (2016); Fiqh Az Zakat A Comparative Study, (1999); Alam, Nafis, Fintech and Islamic finance: Digitalization, development and disruption, pp. 1-178, (2019); Bach, L.

We adapt the working capital framework of successful US companies like Amazon and Walmart and model an innovative Murabaha facility as trade credit within the real sector of the economy. We then test its robustness in a range of simulation tests. Our approach is novel and stands in contrast to the familiar financial sector fixed-income facilities, characteristic of Western economies, stealthily mimicked as mark-up (interest rate based) Murabaha by Islamic banks. We argue that this is neither appropriate nor effective for Islamic economies, making them fragile under monetary pressures in crises like the current coronavirus and energy ones. Our simulation results indicate that the trade credit Murabaha not only transforms debt into a risk-sharing one but also offers more competitive financing rates, reduces systemic risk, and improves financial stability. Furthermore, our results imply that the trade credit Murabaha can increase the efficiency of Islamic financial systems and make them more resilient to shocks. Consequently, this paper discusses the integration of our novel Murabaha within a recreated architecture of Universal Banking. As an implication, this should promote business activity and contribute to global growth. Finally, we recommend how to deploy our novel Murabaha based on trade credit (as opposed to the currently deployed fixed-income-mimicked Murabaha) to alleviate twin agency debt costs (risk shifting, underinvestment) and solve the ownership transfer problem of modern Islamic banking. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crisis; Islamic banking; Mark-up (Murabaha) financing; Trade credit; Universal banking","","","","We are grateful to Dalal Aassouli, Chris Adcock, Habib Ahmed, Nigar Hashimzade, Andreas Jobst, Anthony Miller, Sabur Mollah, Victor Murinde, Bibhas Saha, Mustapha Sheikh, Marti G.

It is important for implementing small and medium-sized initiatives in the country. At the same time, this method of attracting funds in Islamic countries is limited by the complexity of integrating Islamic values with modern financial solutions. This study is devoted to analysing the features of the development of Equity-Based crowdfunding in Oman using the example of the Ethis platform as the only Islamic crowdfunding platform in the country. The methodological basis of the research is qualitative analysis methods based on the analysis of statistical data or quantitative indicators. A conceptual approach was used to analyse scholarly articles, research papers, and online sources related to Islamic Equity-Based crowdfunding. The Islamic Equity-Based crowdfunding platform Ethis was chosen as the subject of the study because it has a successful track record of achieving Shariah-compliant investment goals. Based on the results of the analysis of the functioning of the Islamic share crowdfunding platform in Oman, a conclusion about the importance of adopting the Capital Markets Authority's Decision No. E/153/2021 for developing the crowdfunding industry in Oman was made. The study theoretically proves the important role of CMA's certification in increasing the legitimacy of crowdfunding platforms and public trust in the Omani Equity-Based crowdfunding industry. At the same time, it was concluded that the existing legal restrictions on the expansion of the investor community serve as disincentives for the development of investing in crowdfunding among the general public. In addition, the small number of Equity-Based crowdfunding platforms in Oman is due to the difficulty of combining traditional Islamic values with modern financial technology. It actualises the need to develop a comprehensive approach to the harmonisation of Islamic traditions with the specifics of the development of digital financial technologies. The results of the study are essential for researchers, practitioners and other interested persons from the point of view of deepening the basic principles of crowdfunding development and promoting their implementation in the context of increasing profits from the use of crowdfunding platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crowdfunding; crowdsourcing; Ethis platform; financial technology; Islamic finance; Shariah-compliant","","","","","International Journal of Organizational Analysis, (2022); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); Pitchay, Anwar Allah, Self-determination theory and individuals’ intention to participate in donation crowdfunding, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 15, 3, pp. 506-526, (2022); Access to Finance and Human Developmentessays on Zakah Awqaf and Microfinance, (2015); Alshater, Muneer Maher, Fintech in islamic finance literature: A review, Heliyon, 8, 9, (2022); Baber, Hasnan, Examining the intentions to use crowdfunding platform - An extended technology acceptance model, International Journal of Services, Economics and Management, 12, 2, pp. 149-163, (2021); Innovator S Dilemma, (2000); undefined, (2023); Colombo, Massimo G., Receiving external equity following successfully crowdfunded technological projects: an informational mechanism, Small Business Economics, 56, 4, pp. 1507-1529, (2021)","","Academic Research and Publishing UG","","","","","","25206761; 25206311","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008305145"

The emergence of digital assets, that has encouraged serious discussion, is inseparable from Islamic law. One of these digital assets is the Non-Fungible Token (NFT). This digital asset is the focus of this study, specifically on for its posibility to become material guarantees. This article employs a qualitative study and presented descriptively through the perspective of Islamic law. The result of this study is that the pledged-object (marhūn) has certain primary conditions for it to be functional, namely: it is a property, it has value, it can be traded, its asset value is clearly known, and it is actually owned by the guarantor (rāhin). The concept of marhūn as a valuable object ultimately answers that NFT is included in the marhūn category. However, since NFTs do not stand alone if the transaction currency used in the metaverse is cryptocurrencies, al-rahn transactions using NFTs become less favourable considering Cyrptocurrency is deemed to be haram. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic law; marhūn; metaverse; mortgaging","","","","","The difference between the present and the mortgagee in the capture and recovery of the mortgaged thing in islamic jurisprudence""Comparative jurisprudence Study, 21, 4, pp. 2981-3032; Ahn, Sun Joo (Grace), The Bifold Triadic Relationships Framework: A Theoretical Primer for Advertising Research in the Metaverse, Journal of Advertising, 51, 5, pp. 592-607, (2022); Majallah Kuliyyat Al Dirasat Al Islamiyah Wal Arabiyah Lil Banat Bil Iskandariyah, (2017); Al Sharhal Saghir Ala Aqrab Al Masalikila Madhhab Al Imam Malik, (1986); Al Rahn Fil Fiqh Al Islamiy, (1985); Journal of Islamic Sciences, (2021); Majallah Al Dirasat Al Islamiyah Wal Buhuts Al Akadimiyah, (2021); Tufat Al Fuqah, (2025); Al Majallah Al Urduniyah Fi Al Dirasat Al Islamiyah, (2021); Mughani Al Muhtaj Ela Ma Rifat Ma Ani Alfaz Al Minhaj, (2025)","","Faculty of Law, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta","","","","","","08548919; 25031023","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172223986"

To achieve this, we applied the social representations theory associated with the word evocation test, similarity analysis, and descending hierarchical classification. After analyzing the results, we perceived a partial misalignment between the existing literature on the concept of fintech and the perspective of traditional financial sector professionals concerning this construct. In contrast to the literature surveyed, the respondents lack perception regarding the potential of fintech to constitute disruptive technology for the traditional financial sector—radically transforming or even eliminating it. In addition, traditional financial sector professionals have little insight into the potential of fintech to financially include the low-income population, owing to their lower costs and greater ease of use. Finally, traditional financial sector professionals failed to appreciate the need to develop a legal and regulatory framework for the performance of fintech in emerging markets.

This paper proposes a theoretical model most suitable for Islamic Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) which enables Islamic MFIs’ to operate together with the existing financial models compliant with Islamic Shariah Law. This model is based on a distributed verification/decision-making process that might be realized (but not necessary) through blockchain. Among the available distributed verification techniques, blockchain technology is an attractive emerging computing paradigm due to its decentralized, immutable, shared, and secure data structure characteristics. This model proposes three significant propositions. First, sharing information through blockchain will allow a transparent network in MFI operations, which will raise confidence for donors resulting in a causal effect of a relatively lower profit rate to be charged by the MFIs. Second, the consensus mechanism will enable risk-sharing, a character of Islamic finance; thus, the MFIs will operate without any collateral for low-risk firms. Third, the double bottom line of MFIs' long-lasting paradox would be solved. As for practical implication of this proposed model, the causal impact of lower cost investment by the lenders would increase social welfare because of no collateral and no initial wealth requirement. The proposed model proposes a credit rationing approach where profit can be negative. No collateral will be used when calculating the creditworthiness of a borrower. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Distributed verification; Double bottom line; Islamic microfinance","","","","","Adegbite, Emmanuel Afolabi, Multiple influences on corporate governance practice in Nigeria: Agents, strategies and implications, International Business Review, 22, 3, pp. 524-538, (2013); Ahmad, Abu Umar Faruq, Islamic microfinance: The evidence from Australia, Humanomics, 25, 3, pp. 217-235, (2009); Fintech and Islamic Finance, (2019); Altwijry, Othman Ibrahim, Developing a Shari’ah based FinTech Money Creation Free [SFMCF] model for Islamic banking, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 15, 4, pp. 739-758, (2022); American University Law Review, (2004); Azad, Md Abul Kalam, Efficiency analysis of major microfinance institutions in Bangladesh: a Malmquist index approach, Quality and Quantity, 50, 4, pp. 1525-1537, (2016); Azim, Mohammad I., Combating corruption in a microfinance institution, Managerial Auditing Journal, 32, 4-5, pp. 445-462, (2017); Berger, Allen N., Tests of ex ante versus ex post theories of collateral using private and public information, Journal of Financial Economics, 100, 1, pp. 85-97, (2011); Berns, John P., Delegated monitoring in crowdfunded microfinance: Evidence from Kiva, Journal of Corporate Finance, 66, (2021); Bester, Helmut, Screening vs. Rationing in credit markets with imperfect information, American Economic Review, 75, 4, pp. 850-855, (1985)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21994730","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137083352"

Through its FinTech (Financial Technology) Strategy, Qatar has sought to embrace DLT, but its regulatory approach also remains cautious. Trade Finance is an ideal business process to be disrupted through the benefits of DLT and especially Blockchain technology, since its processes remain antiquated, inefficient and lack digitization. Blockchain as a form of DLT particularly offers the Trade Finance process not only more rapid, secure, cost-effective and efficient procedures, but importantly completely assures trust between importers and exporters and removes the requirement to place such trust in third-party intermediaries. Qatar can reap considerable economic benefits through the enhancement of its Trade Finance regulations enabling the adoption of such Blockchain technology. As such, the authors propose a roadmap and manual for the governance of the Trade Finance Blockchain ecosystem in Qatar.

The transition to low carbon, green economy, and green sustainability has gained momentum simultaneously in developed and developing countries. The greening policy echoes the pending climate change and its entrenching disruptions. Financial technology, or FinTech seems to be a promising direction in unlocking the green dilemma; to be concrete, FinTech and the green economy are separately documented in the literature. Against this background, the current study investigates the intersection between green economic growth and FinTech by conducting a systematic-cum-bibliometric analysis of published papers in the Scopus database with the goal of first examining the role and opportunities of implementing green FinTech as a stimulus for transition towards green economic growth in African countries and, second, identifying knowledge gaps and future policy and research directions by developing an integrated framework to help African countries in the transition to green economic growth and green FinTech. The results illustrate an increasing trend in research attention towards the green FinTech concept and its relationship with green economic growth, climate change, and greening rules and standards. A deep inspection of the mined papers indicates that future research trajectories are oriented into five different mainstreams: technology and instruments in digital finance; regulation, policies, and green FinTech; climate risk mitigation through FinTech; FinTech and environmental quality; green finance and climate change mitigation. Based on these research directions, an integrated framework was conceptualised that aims to deliver green economic growth using FinTech as a vehicle of transition for African countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","African countries; bibliometric review; climate change; green economic growth; green FinTech; sustainability; systematic review","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Finance; Sustainable development; African country; Bibliometric; Bibliometric review; Economic growths; Green economic growth; Green economies; Green fintech; Industrial revolutions; Integrated frameworks; Systematic Review; Climate change","","","","Clim Change Secr Bonn Ger, (2015); Beckerman, Wilfred, Economic growth and the environment: Whose growth? whose environment?, World Development, 20, 4, pp. 481-496, (1992); Scientific American, (1993); Environmental Impacts of A North American Free Trade Agreement, (1991); Global Climate Risk Index 2021, (2021); Report of the Conference of the Parties on Its Fifteenth Session Held in Copenhagen from 7 to 19 December 2009, (2010); Fintech Revolution, (2018); Harnessing Digitalization in Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals Co Chairs Progress Report to the Secretary General of the Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals, (2019); Arner, Douglas W., Sustainability, FinTech and Financial Inclusion, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 1, pp. 7-35, (2020); Financial Stability Implications from Fintech, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142641561"

In cases such as Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) data sharing, when consent might not be enough, many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) still depend on contracts—a GDPR basis that is often overlooked due to its complexity. The contract’s lifecycle comprises many stages (e.g., drafting, negotiation, and signing) that must be executed in compliance with GDPR. Despite the active research efforts on digital contracts, contract-based GDPR compliance and challenges such as contract interoperability have not been sufficiently elaborated on yet. Since knowledge graphs and ontologies provide interoperability and support knowledge discovery, we propose and develop a knowledge graph-based tool for GDPR contract compliance verification (CCV). It binds GDPR’s legal basis to data sharing contracts. In addition, we conducted a performance evaluation in terms of execution time and test cases to validate CCV’s correctness in determining the overhead and applicability of the proposed tool in smart city and insurance application scenarios. The evaluation results and the correctness of the CCV tool demonstrate the tool’s practicability for deployment in the real world with minimum overhead. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data sharing; digital contracts; GDPR compliance; insurance; knowledge graph; ontology; smart cities","Compliance control; Contracts; Graphic methods; Interoperability; Knowledge graph; Life cycle; Smart city; Business-to-business; Compliance verification; Data Sharing; Digital contract; General data protection regulation compliance; General data protection regulations; Knowledge graphs; Ontology's; Regulation compliance; Research efforts; Ontology","","","This work is supported by the Horizon 2020 project smashHit (grant number 871477).","undefined; Proc Conf Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Life Sciences Swat4hcls 2018, (2018); Official Journal of the European Union Oj, (2016); Habib, Hana, Okay, whatever"": An Evaluation of Cookie Consent Interfaces, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2022); undefined; undefined; Li, He, The Impact of GDPR on Global Technology Development, Journal of Global Information Technology Management, 22, 1, pp. 1-6, (2019); Kurteva, Anelia, Consent through the lens of semantics: State of the art survey and best practices, Semantic Web, 15, 3, pp. 647-673, (2024); undefined; undefined","","MDPI","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140608442"

Turkey is one of the largest emerging market economies in the world with a strong banking system and high adoption of technology, so it has great potential to benefit from fintech solutions to boost sustainable finance. For the case analysis, the data used came from a research platform for a Turkish start-up ecosystem, Turkish regulations, and documents released on Turkey’s sustainable finance strategies by Turkish and international institutions. We found that Turkey has made remarkable progress in increasing financial inclusivity for underbanked individuals and SMEs via providing contactless payment and contract systems and microfinance by mobile carriers and other online platforms. Turkey was also able to promote the responsible consumption goal for sustainable development by improving fintech solutions on payment systems with educational content on this goal.

While research on the impact of tokenization on financial markets is extensive, literature provides virtually no description of mathematical models that can be used in the design and development of information systems issuing tokenized financial instruments. Thus, the study aims to develop mathematical models representing the transformation of the over-the-counter (OTC) securities market induced by the tokenization of underlying assets. The development of crowdlending platforms is gradually transforming the financial market landscape. The key change trends consist in transactional fragmentation both on the demand and supply sides. This paper proposes a mathematical model of internal transformation occurring in the OTC financial market, which describes the process of managing rights to underlying assets during their issuance and circulation. The model is built by analogy with the Harrison–Ruzzo–Ullman (HRU) model, applying the same principles to the relations of economic agents in exercising access rights to underlying assets as those that regulate access rights to files. The research novelty of the presented model consists in the formalization of financial market transformation occurring in the context of asset tokenization, which significantly expands the mathematical apparatus of digital financial transactions. This paper also proposes a mathematical model of competitive tokenization-induced transformation occurring in the OTC financial market, which describes transaction costs associated with attracting investment in the OTC financial market and the market for tokenized assets. In addition, the barriers of the OTC financial market and the stock market are described indicating the supply and demand trends in the context of transformation occurring in the OTC financial market under the influence of underlying asset tokenization. The novelty of this model lies in the mathematical formalization of the investment attraction process in the market for tokenized assets. The theoretical value of the developed models consists in the confirmation of significantly expanded supply capabilities of tokenized assets on the graph showing the dependence of asset returns on invested capital. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","asset tokenization; crowdlending; model; OTC securities market; transformation","","","","The article was prepared in accordance with the research plan of the Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (No. 0327-2021-0005).","Ullah, Assad, Exploring asymmetric relationship between Islamic banking development and economic growth in Pakistan: Fresh evidence from a non-linear ARDL approach, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 4, pp. 6168-6187, (2021); Ullah, Assad, Modeling the relationship between military spending and stock market development (a) symmetrically in China: An empirical analysis via the NARDL approach, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 554, (2020); Hein, Andreas, Digital platform ecosystems, Electronic Markets, 30, 1, pp. 87-98, (2020); Yonatany, Moshe, Platforms, ecosystems, and the internationalization of highly digitized organizations, Journal of Organization Design, 6, 1, (2017); Revista Brasileira De Inovacao, (2020); Kretschmer, Tobias, Platform ecosystems as meta-organizations: Implications for platform strategies, Strategic Management Journal, 43, 3, pp. 405-424, (2022); Riasanow, Tobias, Core, intertwined, and ecosystem-specific clusters in platform ecosystems: analyzing similarities in the digital transformation of the automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance and IIoT industry, Electronic Markets, 31, 1, pp. 89-104, (2021); Valente, Eduardo, Sharing economy: becoming an Uber driver in a developing country, Revista de Gestao, 26, 2, pp. 143-160, (2019); Popov, Evgeny Vasilievich, Mathematical support for financing social innovations, Mathematics, 8, 12, pp. 1-31, (2020); Nigmonov, Asror, FinTech and macroeconomics: Dataset from the US peer-to-peer lending platform, Data in Brief, 39, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139870300"

Reverse factoring occurs when a buying firm offers a reduced short-term borrowing rate to a supplier company in exchange for longer payment terms. From the standpoint of a supplier, this paper investigates the impact of rating changes, interest rate fluctuations, and business cycle position on the cost-benefit trade-off in the SMEs and manufacturing companies. However, the data was collected using a questionnaire. The main result is that changes in critical financial variables like ratings, news alerts and interest rates will shift former win–win circumstances for the supplier dependent on the business cycle into win–lose situations for the supplier. Overall, the reverse factoring results reveal sophisticated trade-offs, necessitating careful consideration in managerial decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Interest Rates; Reverse Factoring; SMEs; Supply Chain Finance and Manufacturing Companies","","","","","Abbasi, Kashif Raza, Asymmetric impact of renewable and non-renewable energy on the industrial sector in Pakistan: Fresh evidence from Bayesian and non-linear ARDL, Renewable Energy, 187, pp. 944-957, (2022); Almatarneh, Zeyad, The role of management accounting in the development of supply chain performance in logistics manufacturing companies, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 10, 1, pp. 13-18, (2022); Alzaqebah, Malek, Memory based cuckoo search algorithm for feature selection of gene expression dataset, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 24, (2021); Alzaqebah, Malek, Improved Multi-Verse Optimizer Feature Selection Technique with Application to Phishing, Spam, and Denial of Service Attacks, International Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security, 13, 1, pp. 76-81, (2021); Alzaqebah, Malek, Hybrid feature selection method based on particle swarm optimization and adaptive local search method, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 2414-2422, (2021); Ayoush, Maha D., The Impact of Mergers on the Financial Performance of Jordanian Public Shareholding Companies, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 7, 10, pp. 751-759, (2020); Bandyopadhyay, Arindam, Factors determining capital structure and corporate performance in India: Studying the business cycle effects, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 61, pp. 160-172, (2016); Begenau, Juliane, Capital requirements, risk choice, and liquidity provision in a business-cycle model, Journal of Financial Economics, 136, 2, pp. 355-378, (2020); Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, (2025); Beyer, Hans Martin, Supply chain finance: cost–benefit differentials under reverse factoring with extended payment terms, International Journal of Financial Studies, 9, 4, (2021)","","Growing Science","","","","","","22916822; 22916830","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137322545"

In this study, several potential application areas of blockchain with promising benefits have been identified in the natural gas industry. There is no single solution that can address different challenges and meet disparate requirements. Therefore, it is important to understand the needs of the natural gas industry and propose appropriate blockchain solutions. Moreover, in the literature, there is a lack of detailed case studies involving industrial experts from the natural gas sector. Expert opinion can be useful for prioritizing the most needed or expected blockchain application areas among several options. By considering privacy, authentication, speed, security, energy consumption, and costs, suitable blockchain types and consensus mechanisms can be determined. This study presents one of the first detailed case studies for tailored applications of blockchain in the natural gas industry. Through a two-staged semi-structured interview with executives from SOCAR Azerbaijan, the most important blockchain application areas and operational requirements were identified. Furthermore, the most suitable blockchain solutions that can address application-specific conditions and needs were determined.

We proposed a theoretical model by combining the technology paradox framework and self-efficacy theory. There were 418 valid questionnaires collected via an online survey. This study demonstrates, using structural equation modeling (SEM), that self-efficacy significantly affects technology paradoxes, anxiety, and resistance. Moreover, it suggests that the relationship between technology paradoxes and anxiety varies, and users are more concerned about the dissatisfiers of technology paradoxes (inefficiency and public). Besides, a positive correlation was found between anxiety and resistance. Finally, the results of the mediating effects test show that self-efficacy can not only directly affect resistance, but also indirectly influence it through efficiency, public, and anxiety.

This study employs two-stage least square (2SLS) methods on the annual data of 217 Islamic banks from 35 countries ranging from 2010 to 2019. We find that the relationship between risk-based capital and risk-taking behaviour is negative, and the results are heterogeneous across different regions concerning both signs and significance. Consistent with the theory of moral hazard, we find the negative relationship between risk-based capital and Islamic banks’ risk-taking behaviour, implying that managers in Islamic banks could increase their investment in risky assets and keep only smaller amounts of capital. The concept of profit and loss sharing motivates them to take a higher risk and aim to get a higher yield. This relationship is also in line with the agency theory, inferring that bank managers could take excessive risk to get higher compensation to align with higher profitability. The results also reveal a positive relationship between risk-taking and profitability, which is in line with the portfolio theory in finance. The findings in our paper would be useful for decision-makers and bank managers in understanding the interrelationship between risk, capital, and profitability and no factor alone could be good enough to ensure bank soundness. Furthermore, our findings imply that regulators and bank managers should not only focus on bank capital for increasing banks’ stability.

Global adoption of fintech is rapidly increasing due to its disruptive nature and is largely embraced by participants who are underserved by traditional financial service providers. Global investments in fintech are growing rapidly year by year owing to increased interconnectivity with the digital revolution. Fintech is expansive, engulfing a plethora of innovative applications in various services including payments, financing, asset management, insurance, etc. There exists a gap in the literature and visualization research on impact and future pathway of fintech innovations in payments and financial services and role of financial regulations. This study aims to enrich the understanding of fintech innovations in payments and financing and investigate the correlation and significance of regulatory framework in maintaining a fair ecosystem. With this objective, an extant systematic review was performed using research articles published in peer-reviewed journals for the period 2014–2022 when there has been a burgeoning of interest in ‘fintech’ globally. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical constructs of fintech innovations in the financial services industry and show that such innovations play a crucial role in shaping the nature of future of business.

The present research aimed at exploring the underlying determinant factors that shape the investors’ intentions to fund in a crowdfunding platform, a phenomenon still under-researched in the developing world. To bridge this void in the literature, we investigated how calculus and relational trust mediate the effects of perceived accreditation, blockchain technology, structural assurance, and third-party seal on the investors’ intention using the SEM technique to analyze the data collected from 110 platform investors in Pakistan. Findings suggest that third-party seal and blockchain technology strongly influence the calculus trust. While the investors’ intention to invest is mediated by calculus trust, the relational trust fails to show any mediation effect, suggesting that investors make investment decisions based on what makes sense to them cognitively instead of affectively.

The increase in NFT transactions has drawn the attention of the art market to the consequent carbon emissions resulting from verifying transactions in proof-of-work blockchains supporting NFT transactions. With CO<inf>2</inf>-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-of-work blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols. Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains. Linking the damage caused by proof-of-work blockchains to climate change and human mortality, this study examines the recent policy interventions designed to motivate a shift in blockchain consensus protocols and promote miners' energy efficiency to mitigate environmental damage.

The revolution of the internet and smartphones has changed human life, as happens in smart contracts. This difference in character between smart and conventional contracts has not been fully anticipated by applicable law. That is why the urgency of fiqh renewal or reform of the law in the cyberspace era. Although smart contracts are still in their infancy, and there are still many critical issues that need to be resolved, the results of the literature research show that the smart contract has fulfilled the principles in the agreement/contract in Islamic law. According to the ITE Law, a smart contract can be interpreted as an agreement referred to in Article 1313 of the Civil Code, ""an act where one person binds himself to one or more other people"". Although this study is not sufficient, this needs to be elaborated from the perspective of Indonesian law. The most important things in smart contracts to comply with the Islamic law are: the sequence of processes in the smart contract must comply with Islamic law, the object being transacted must be halal, the perpetrators have complied with the provisions of the Islamic law, fixed price during the contract period and the number of parties involved in the contract may increase over time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","block chain; Indonesian law; Islamic law; Smart contract","","","","","Al Buyu Ash Syaia Wa Asar Dawabit Al Mabi Ala Syariyyatiha, (1998); Blockchain Based Smart Contracts A Systematic Mapping Study, (2017); International Journal of Advanced Research, (2020); Journal of Lex Generalis Jls, (2021); Plas 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security Co Located with Ccs 2016; Capgemini Consulting, (2016); Chen, Ting, Under-optimized smart contracts devour your money, pp. 442-446, (2017); Delmolino, Kevin, Step by step towards creating a safe smart contract: Lessons and insights from a cryptocurrency lab, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9604 LNCS, pp. 79-94, (2016); Mudah Dan Bijak Memahami Masalah Akad Syariah, (2011); Hukum Perkawinan Islam Di Indonesia, (2006)","","State Institute for Islamic Studies Curup","","","","","","25483374; 25483382","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163801187"

Hadiths are an example of one of the historical texts that should be securely preserved. Due to the expansion of the online resources, fabrications and alterations of fake Hadiths are easily feasible. Therefore, it has become more challenging to authenticate the online available Hadith contents and much harder to keep these authenticated results secure and unmanipulated. In this research, we are using the capabilities of the distributed blockchain technology to securely archive the Hadith and its level of authenticity in a blockchain. We selected a permissioned blockchain customized model in which the main entities approving the level of authenticity of the Hadith are well-established and specialized institutions in the main Islamic countries that can apply their own Hadith validation model. The proposed solution guarantees its integrity using the crowd wisdom represented in the selected nodes in the blockchain, which uses voting algorithms to decide the insertion of any new Hadiths into the database. This technique secures data integrity at any given time. If any organization’s credentials are compromised and used to update the data maliciously, 50% + 1 approval from the whole network nodes will be required. In case of any malicious or misguided information during the state of reaching consensus, the system will self-heal using practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT).

Therefore, the motivation of this research is to investigate the perceptions of Shari'ah scholars and financial experts on the concepts and salient features of Shari'ah-compliant precious metal backed crypto-currency (PMC). To achieve this, this study adopted a qualitative method using semi-structured interview based on saturation technique. The results from Shari'ah advisors and financial experts indicated that the informants have differences of views on the assets-backed money, but they agreed that it ensures stability of money and adding the cryptocurrency technology is found to be desirable and recommendable. It is also found that PMC would be subjected to financial regulation challenges and using blockchain technology will increase the transparency. The informants agreed that PMC is closer to Maq sid al-Shari'ah and there is some form of justice and equality compared to the current interest-based financial system. Therefore, the informants recommended the implementation of PMC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cryptocurrency; perceptions; precious metal; Shari'ah oriented","currency; financial market; implementation process; Internet; investment; metal; perception; technological development","","","","Accounting Auditing and Governance Standards, (2015); Shari Ah Standards for Islamic Financial Institutions, (2017); Diminishing Partnership as an Alternative Islamic Home Financing in Malaysia Issues and Perceptions, (2011); Al Shajarah Journal of the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization Istac, (2015); Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Islamic Currency, (2016); Ihya Ulum Ud Din, (2004); Fatwa on the Islamic Ruling on Cryptocurrency, (2018); Bezemer, Dirk J., Schumpeter might be right again: the functional differentiation of credit, Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 24, 5, pp. 935-950, (2014); Bank Negara Malaysia Issues Policy Document for Digital Currencies, (2018)","","World Scientific","","","","","","02175908; 17936837","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090561764"

It has served to cater to the capital requirements of big corporations and governments, while circumventing interest to adhere to the Shariah law. Sukuk can be touted as Shariah-compliant bonds that rank among the most successful and the fastest growing financial instrument in the Islamic economy. The sukuk research area is marked by a dearth of quantitative literature, compared to qualitative academic work. This paper seeks to fill this existing gap, and introduces a novel, exploratory analysis of sukuk tokenization based on a case study. The funding needs of small and medium enterprises remains largely unmet through sukuk on account of the high costs involved, among other reasons. As we show in this paper, blockchains can aid to lower the cost incurred through the tokenization of sukuk. We highlight some of the key challenges involved in the issuance of sukuk and discuss their resolution using blockchain. We also provide a taxonomy of blockchain applications in finance, with a particular focus on Islamic finance. Our paper reviews different blockchain architectures to assess their viability for tokenization. We conduct a novel case study on sukuk tokenization by implementing a basic smart contract for Sukuk al-Murabaha on Ethereum. The paper concludes by a conceptual analysis of feasibility concerns, based on a comparison of the conducted cost-benefit analysis of conventional sukuk issuance with tokenization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cost-benefit analysis; Ethereum; Smart contract; Sukuk; Tokenization","","","","This work is funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under its AFR-PPP Programme, which is aimed at providing PhD and Post Doc grants for innovation and industry partnerships under grant number FNR11617092 .","Agbo, Cornelius Chidubem, Blockchain technology in healthcare: A systematic review, Healthcare (Switzerland), 7, 2, (2019); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2020); Almadhoun, Randa, A User Authentication Scheme of IoT Devices using Blockchain-Enabled Fog Nodes, Proceedings of IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA, 2018-November, (2018); undefined, (2019); Amazon Ec2 Reserved Instances Pricing, (2019); Bartoletti, Massimo, An Empirical analysis of smart contracts: Platforms, applications, and design patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10323 LNCS, pp. 494-509, (2017); Chaer, Abdulla, Blockchain for 5G: Opportunities and challenges, (2019); Chauhan, Anamika, Blockchain and Scalability, pp. 122-128, (2018); Chiu, Jonathan, Blockchain-Based Settlement for Asset Trading, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1716-1753, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","10440283","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085772061"

The positive growth of this financial sector is not supported by proportional rules, resulting in the practices of business ethics violation which is detrimental to society. To overcome these problems, the spirit of Islam can be the basis for determining ethical and business measures into a better legal framework for Fintech P2P Lending. This article applies a normative legal research method using a conceptual approach and legislation relevant to the theme of the study. The research results indicate that Fintech P2P Lending in Indonesia needs to be regulated in a qualified legal framework because the existing rules have not been able to solve unethical actions of businessmen. The business concept in Islam also accommodates ethical issues that must be applied in business activities as a harmless commerce spirit. This Islamic spirit can be used as a source of material law in determining a clear legal framework to uphold Fintech P2P Lending business ethics so as not to harm the Indonesian people. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Ethics; Fintech; Islamic Law; Peer-to-peer lending","","","","","Review of Managerial Science, (2021); Ijictdc, (2018); International Business Research, (2017); Andalusi, Zainul Arif, Future Package Financing Products With Akad Murabahah in The Perspective of Sharia Economics Law, Ahkam: Jurnal Ilmu Syariah, 19, 2, pp. 373-390, (2019); Anshari, Muhammad, Financial Technology with AI-Enabled and Ethical Challenges, Society, 58, 3, pp. 189-195, (2021); Peradilan Etik Dan Etika Konstitusi, (2016); Mich Bus Entrepreneurial L Rev, (2021); Rise and Development of Fintech, (2019); Research Methods for Business A Skill Building Approach, (2010); Law in Context, (2019)","","Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang","","","","","","20867549; 25283383","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190961039"

This study aims to compare riba and gharar on digital payment applications in Malaysia and Indonesia. This research is normative juridical research with conceptual and comparative approaches. The main part of the focus, first, Securities Commission Malaysia has divided digital currencies into two categories, namely digital currencies based on technology without underlying assets and the ones based on riba goods. For the former currencies, it is categorized as urudh and is not considered a currency from sharia point of view, nor it is a riba commodity. Second, Based on Islamic law, the use of digital payment applications between Malaysia and Indonesia is permissible. Riba issues can occur if the floating funds stored at the service provider are used improperly. Floating funds should not get any additional to avoid riba. Lucky draws and lottery given after doing top-up are riba because of the uncertainty. Digital payments are developing both in Malaysia and Indonesia so this research can provide an overview of the differences between riba and gharar in digital payment instruments in both countries and it’s law. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital payment; gharar; Islamic law; riba","","","","","Shariah Analysis of Earning Income Via Foreign Exchange Forex Trading A Guide for the Singapore Muslim Community Fazrihan Duriat Mustafiyah Kadir Sahib Shabana Hasan Haron Masagoes Hassan Shahrizan Mansor and Zul Hakim Academia Edu; Halal and Haram Aspects of Cryptocurrencies in Islam Sudais Asif Academia Edu; Pdf Bitcoin Dan Analisis Pandangan Fiqh Islam; Bahjah Qulub Al Abrar Wa Qurratu Uyuuni Al Akhyaar Fi Syarhi Jawaami Al Akhbaar; Majmuah Al Fawaid Al Bahiyyah, (2000); Tuhfat Al Muhtaj Fi Sharh Al Minhaj, (2025); Kitab Al Buyu; Al Fiqh Al Islami Wa Adillatuh, (1997); Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance is the State Still Necessary, (2015); Nazariyyah Al Gharar Fi Al Syari Ah Al Islamiyyah, (1973)","","Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang","","","","","","20867549; 25283383","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190760867"

Due to crowdfunding, the way the products are brought into the market by entrepreneurs and established companies has been changed. Most companies are turning to crowdfunding in order to enhance research development and innovation. Since 2019, Bahrain is home to a debt-based crowdfunding platform. A great example of finance raised through crowdfunding would be that of Oculus VR, well known for virtual reality. Oculus was funded through Kickstarter which is among the leading crowdfunding platforms. The resultant capital was tenfold higher than the target investment [149]. Islamic finance can highly benefit from this because it satisfies the basic principle of sharia-compliant banking. Crowdfunding doesn’t involve interest payments and is done to support small or medium sized business who would otherwise be excluded [150], [151]. The investors of a crowdfunding project are collectively sharing profits and the risk is low because it is diversified among them. Islamic crowdfunding would require investment in halal projects and would be extremely suitable to the millions of Muslims who struggle to raise capital to start a business [150], [152]. Crowdfunding would also satisfy the Islamic rule of being socially responsible by supporting a business and in turn profiting together without the loss of another [153]. The Central Bank of Bahrain has launched traditional and sharia-compliant crowdfunding for small and medium sized enterprises. However, even with government initiatives, crowdfunding hasn’t raised a lot of demand. This could be due to inadequate awareness, lack of technical knowledge and slow electronic process [154]. Nevertheless, Islamic crowdfunding is a valuable program for creative entrepreneurs which gives them a way out of the traditional financing methods and consists of less risk. Initiatives must be put in place to encourage sharia-compliant crowdfunding for those who are unaware and might be in need. Government can ease the procedures involved and pace up the process. There must be a push in this direction of financing in the Islamic world to lift small & medium businesses and promote collective well-being.

Though organizations' management have adopted measures prescribed by the literature, these measures have been unable to provide a fit-for-all solution. This has motivated this study to re-examine the organizational resilience factors driving operational performance in the post-pandemic era, specifically in consideration of the role of firm industry orientation and firm size. Thus, the preset study aims it to identify to what extent the organizational resilience (ability, adaptability, agility and flexibility) effects the operational performance; and, to determine how the firm size influence the relationship between organizational resilience and the operational performance of the manufacturing and service sectors. Data was collected from 85 organizations in the Malaysian manufacturing and services industries and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results show that the agility and flexibility dimensions of resilience have a significant positive effect on operational performance, while the ability and adaptability dimensions have no such effect. Additionally, firm size was found to be insignificant in the relationship between organizational resilience and operational performance. The findings reveal that resilience is vital for the sustainability of an organization in this turbulent and complex business climate. Therefore, managers should thus consider incorporating appropriate resilience strategies in both opportunities and operations to embrace different strategies to leverage organizational resilience post COVID. Ultimately, the government should utilize these findings for policymaking when leading post-COVID-19 projects and initiatives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","manufacturing and services industries; operational performance; Organizational resilience; PLS-SEM; post-COVID-19","","","","The researchers thank all the participants (managers) who responded to the questionnaire within a short period despite their busy schedules.

The study uses the Global Financial Development Indicators Data from 2011, 2014, and 2018 published by the World bank. Graphical trend analysis, covariance, and correlation analysis are used to examine the role of digital payments, the use of the credit card, and use of the debit card to find out their impact on Fintech and the distribution of credit to the private sector. The results suggest that the use of financial technology is increasing in the GCC region, and the use of digital payments, debit cards, and credit cards have a linear dependence on each other and positively contribute to the distribution of credit to the private sector – hence, to financial intermediation in certain aspects. The results also show that Saudi Arabia is ranked four among six regional economies in terms of the use of digital finance. It is also observed that the country has potential for Fintech growth both in terms of supply and demand. To tap into this potential, regulators have introduced a regulatory sandbox to facilitate Fintech startups.

An interpretative qualitative research approach is employed, with case studies of Malaysian public university waqf administrators, and data analysis is performed using open, axial, and selective coding. The findings suggest that in terms of coercive isomorphism there are two transparency challenges related to blockchain solutions in the waqf management system: 1) errors in the issuance of receipts (process), which are expected to be overcome by blockchain solutions in the form of individual network technology and ID identifiers; and 2) difficulties in waqf distribution (process), which are predicted to be solved by blockchain solutions in the form of controlling tools, public ledgers, and obtaining waqf distribution data. In normative isomorphism, there are two accountability challenges with blockchain solutions in the waqf management system: 1) difficulties in controlling waqf activities (process), which are expected to be overcome by blockchain solutions which allow internal control; and 2) decisions on waqf distribution (output), which should be solved by blockchain solutions which allow awareness among stakeholders of waqf distribution. In mimetic isomorphism, there is one accountability challenge in the process which has blockchain solutions in the waqf management system, namely system integration, which is predicted to be overcome by a blockchain solution related to traceability.

Design/methodology/approach: This study was designed as a conceptual research model to verify the mediating effect of integration and collaboration in the relationship trust and relationship commitment and supply chain performance. In order to design a conceptual research model, a total 30 items were investigated and the SEM method was verified using six observations variables Findings: According to this study, it was found that financial and non-financial performance of companies adopting Korea's supply chain management increased when trust and relationship commitment were strengthened with partner companies. In particular, in the relationship between trust of supply chain management and supply chain management performance, integration with partner companies contributed to increase financial performance, but did not make a positive contribution to non-financial performance. On the other hand, in the relationship between supply chain management's relationship commitment and supply chain management, collaboration made a positive contribution to increasing financial and non-financial performance. What this study means is that higher trust and relationship commitment with partner companies in supply chain management contributed to a direct influence on financial and non-financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study used the citation count to measure the effect of trust and relationship on supply chain performance. While this serves the purpose of this study, citation counts may not perfectly represent the value and impact of a study. The findings of this study provide a guide post for future studies.

In 1792 in America, the official price of gold was USD 19.3939/oz, whilst in 2021 the average market price of gold is about USD 1,800/oz, thus one dollar in 1792 is now only worth 1 cent in 2021 (19.3939/1,800). Most of this devaluation occurred since 1971, which represents a catastrophic collapse in the store of value function of money over the past fifty years, confirming a failure in contemporary monetary theory and policy in achieving monetary and price stability under the fiat standard. The loss of purchasing power as a result of this devaluation is so profound that the associated confiscation of wealth, due to inflation, has undermined all wealth creation in real terms. Fiat currencies have now discovered their true intrinsic wealth and are essentially worthless. By conducting a survey of classical Islamic literature, this study seeks to re-examine our understanding of money to encourage monetary reform to develop future solutions, given the failure of the fiat standard in satisfying the objectives of the sharīʿah (maqasid al-sharīʿah) in terms of protection of wealth (hifiz al-māl) and imparting social justice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic economics; Islamic monetary theory; maqasid al-sharīʿah; monetary economics","","","","","Abdullah, Adam, Economic security requires monetary and price stability: Analysis of Malaysian macroeconomic and credit data, Al-Shajarah, 20, Specialissue, pp. 205-247, (2015); Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Abdullah, Adam, Examining US approvals of Islamic financing products and the Islamic theory of lawful profit, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 9, 4, pp. 532-550, (2016); Islamic Currency, (2016); Abdullah, Adam, Towards stabilization of the World Monetary System: A Shariah Perspective, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 30, 2, pp. 71-78, (2017); Money and the Real Economy an Islamic Perspective, (2018); Islamic Economics, (2018); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2018); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Studies, (2020); Abdullah, Adam, Modern Monetary Theory or Islamic Monetary Theory of Value?

The rules imposed by the Financial Services Authority (FSA/ Otoritas Jasa Keuangan/OJK) have aspects of riba that contradict sharia compliance principles. This study determines alternative solutions to unfair practices in conventional Fintech, especially peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) in Indonesian banking practices. The research uses normative and empirical methods with statutory and empirical data from library research and interviews. The study shows the presence of economic immorality in conventional P2P loan practices, such as maisyir, gharar, riba, dzalim, and haram, which are contrary to Islamic principles. This necessitates the application of primary sharia principles in sharia fintech. Thus, Islamic P2P Lending is an alternative solution to Islamic banking’s financial technology practices for customers using conventional fintech services. This is due to challenges in conventional fintech, including illegal fintech, intimidation in debt financing, high-interest rates, and the use of unlawful personal data. Therefore, the principles of sharia compliance and good faith are alternative solutions to strengthen sharia fintech and protect consumers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative solutions; Indonesia; Islamic fintech; P2P lending","","","","The authors express gratitude to the Institute for Research, Community Service, and Publications of the Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta for its funding and the Grant for Scientific Publication support in this series of international scientific journals.","Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); Academia Edu; Global Journal of Finance and Management, (2016); undefined, (2007); Kepatuhan Syariah Di Lembaga Keuangan Syariah Lks Optimalkah from Dakwatuna Com, (2017); Apa Itu Industri Financial Technology Fintech Indonesia, (2016); Fong, Adrian, Regulation of peer-to-peer lending in Hong Kong: State of play, Law and Financial Markets Review, 9, 4, pp. 251-259, (2015); An Introduction to Islamic Economics and Finance, (2005); undefined","","Universiti Utara Malaysia Press","","","","","","2229984X; 01279483","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124526163"

The study examines Indonesian Islamic corporates using data from the ISSI (Indonesia Shariah Stock Index). We gathered annual reports and sustainability reports from the ISSI database for the year 2019. The study investigates how human governance (HG), Islamic corporate governance (ICG), and information technology usage (ITU) are related to sustainability reporting disclosure (SR). The findings showed that the sustainability reporting disclosure was significantly influenced by human governance and Islamic corporate governance with firm size and leverage. Furthermore, the research showed that profitability was not significantly related to sustainability reporting disclosure, that Islamic corporate governance had a significant negative influence on SR, and that IT usage was only significant when human governance was not present. Finally, the results showed that human governance is the main driver of sustainability reporting disclosure.

These rules are predetermined by computer codes and then copied and implemented by the servers in the entire network.

Farmers are often reluctant to be covered for their crops due to lack of trust in insurance firms and the fear of delayed or non-payment of claims. In this paper, a blockchain based crop insurance solution is suggested. The solution suggested in this paper is an affordable, efficient, low cost crop insurance solution which will ensure many farmers are insured and benefiting from timely crop insurance. Currently the cost of administering insurance is an essential barrier to accessing this fa-cility. With the proper use of blockchain based on ethereum this expense can be reduced dramati-cally. We have conducted various tests on platforms such as Google Cloud and found that the least throughput is 165 transactions. Upon analysis we have found that the time taken by the block for-mation is directly proportional to the timing of processing. The end-to-end average latency of the system was achieved as 31.2 s, which was quite effective for the infrastructure what we are using.

The first purpose is to examine the perception of Islamic finance experts and Shariah scholars on the Islamic cryptocurrency (i.e., GOLDX and OneGram). The question is whether it has a role in reconciling cryptocurrency in Islamic finance. The second is to introduce the new Islamic cryptocurrency to serve these rich Islamic populaces. The study used a qualitative research approach by conducting interviews to explore the Islamic scholars’ views on the framework of the new Islamic cryptocurrency. The scholars have been deemed to meet particular requirements of having comprehensive knowledge and have extensive experience in both the Islamic Shariah and cryptocurrency. Accordingly, the number of such scholars was limited, and eventually, with the access offered only to five scholars from different Islamic countries. We thoroughly analyzed the collected data from the interviews. The findings reveal that Islamic law is absent on the essential models for the conventional cryptocurrency utilization(such as bitcoin) as either a legitimate or illicit apparatus exchange device. Consequently, introducing new Islamic cryptocurrencies is to reconcile cryptocurrencies such as GOLDX and OneGram.

The basic ethical tenets available in the Islamic financial system make it more suited and readymade to fight the economic aftershocks of a pandemic like COVID-19. The basic principles of ethical Islamic finance have solid connections to financial stability and corporate social responsibility within the wide-reaching business context.

However, conventional and sharia fintech are two different systems and should have each regulation. The problem is if sharia fintech regulations in Indonesia is appropriate. Then what about Malaysia which are considered successful in developing the sharia fintech. This study compares sharia fintech regulations in Indonesia and Malaysia. The aim is to find out the readiness of Indonesia and Malaysia in supporting the sharia fintech trend realized in the regulations. This is a qualitative research using books and academic articles as an addition to the literature and regulations as the analytical method. The results indicate that Indonesia and Malaysia try to accommodate sharia fintech regulations. Indonesia still uses The Financial Services Authority Regulation (POJK) and Bank Indonesia regulations, both of which do not meet the sharia principles. Meanwhile, Malaysia uses the 2013 Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA), a law to regulate sharia compliance of the Islamic financial services sector, including the Sharia Fintech. In addition, Malaysia also has a Sharia Advisory Council as a supervisor for the Islamic financial services implementations. Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s regulations have yet answered the sharia fintech developments.

Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. Blockchain technology can assist in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by assuring safe and reliable medical supplies, accurate identification of virus hot spots, and establishing data provenance to verify genuine personal protective equipment that is decentralized, reliable, traceable, and transparent. A major proportion of current healthcare systems are centralized and are short on privacy and information necessary for the detection of fraud connected to the certification by the COVID-19 vaccine. The quick vaccination rollout and the deployment of a global vaccination campaign are crucial and dependent on the availability of transparent and operational distribution chains, which may be audited by all the necessary parties. Blockchain technology might also be used to assure transparent monitoring, storage, and distribution of COVID19 vaccinations. Smart contracts are built for monitoring and tracking the proper circumstances of vaccine distribution in comparison to safe handling of vaccine producers, informing all network peers. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of block chain and smart contracts in the health care system. The article presents a model of the decentralized infrastructure of the health care system. The blockchain and intelligent contract technology provided has shown promising results. The proposed solution is economically feasible and ensures data integrity, security, transparency, and traceability.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a mono-method qualitative approach. Data were obtained from survey interviews of two issuances on the fusion of smart contracts in Ṣukūk structures that were Sharīʿah-compliant. A thematic approach was further used to analyze the interview data based on the onion research method while opportunities and challenges of activating the Smart Ṣukūk (SṢ) relied on doctrinal evidence. Findings: The results from the issuances across two jurisdictions showed that deployment of SṢ can resolve contractual ambiguities arising from Sharīʿah interpretations, jurisdictional policies and legal regime issues, which affect Ṣukūk origination and issuances especially on the right of investors in the event of Ṣukūk defaults. Although SṢ is automated, the third party’s presence is not eliminated as the blockchain platform still relies on the validators who are usually blockchain developers functioning as a third party in the Ṣukūk chain. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on doctrinal literature to explain the features and requirements of SṢ. The empirical approach is limited to interview data based on local SṢ issuances. Future studies need to explore regulators’ role and global standards in cross-border issuance of SṢ with multiple jurisdictions/laws. Practical implications: The paper concludes that the offering of SṢ using local currency has been successful in the two issuances because of the facilitative regulatory environment. However, addressing Ṣukūk’s challenges in cross-border offerings would require guidance from international standard-setters such as the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions and the Islamic Financial Services Board. Originality/value: This study is an advanced application of smart contracts to alleviate the related Ṣukūk challenges in the Islamic capital market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Sharīʿah-compliance; Smart Ṣukūk; Ṣukūk challenges","","","","","Malaysian Journal of Society and Space, (2016); Shariah Analysis of Bitcoin Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, (2018); Al Nahda, (2014); Badiu Al Aniu Tartb Shariu, (1986); Dirsat Fiqhiyah Iqtidiyah Ma Badilu Maqbla Sharan, (2018); Santander Settles both Sides of A 20 Million Bond Trade on Ethereum, (2019); Alswaidan, Mohammed Waleed, Understanding and evaluation of risk in Sukuk structures, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 8, 4, pp. 389-405, (2017); Al Hikmah Journal, (2019); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2019); Business Blockchain Promise Practice and Application of the Next Internet Technology, (2016)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17590825; 17590817","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114185464"

Internal variables comprise capital adequacy ratio (CAR), financing to deposit ratio (FDR), return on assets (ROA), operating expense ratio (OER), financing to value (FTV) and profit and loss sharing (PLS) financing ratio. External variables comprise inflation, economic growth and interest rate. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the annual reports of SRBs in Indonesia as secondary data for the years 2010–2019. Auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) is used as the analysis method to examine the short-run and long-run relationships between the variables. Findings: The findings indicate that four variables experienced a lag in the short run, namely, NPF, inflation, CAR and PLS, with different results recorded for each of the variables. Furthermore, the long-run results show that CAR and ROA influence the NPF of SRBs positively, whereas inflation and PLS have a negative influence on NPF. The rest of the variables – notably economic growth, interest rate, FDR, FTV and OER – do not have an influence on NPF in SRBs. Research limitations/implications: The level of NPF in SRBs exceeds the provision of the Central Bank of Indonesia.

However, the economic policy uncertainty is aggravated by problems, such as economic slump and trade friction. Thus, institutional investors are not optimistic about the prospects of innovation investment. To explore the influence of institutional investors on corporate innovation investment from the perspective of economic policy uncertainty, using the 2010-2018 panel data in China and the fixed effect model, the influences of institutional investors on innovation investment and the moderating effects of the economic policy uncertainty were analyzed. Results show that institutional investors facilitate corporate innovation investment. Moreover, the increasing economic policy uncertainties repress the promoting effect of institutional investors on innovation investment. Furthermore, the institutional investors boost the corporate innovation investment by improving the internal control and relieving the financing constraints. For private companies, new and high-tech companies, the promoting effect of institutional investors on the corporate innovation investment is inhibited by the economic policy uncertainty to a small extent. For the listed companies located in areas with a high level of investor protection and intellectual property protection, the economic policy uncertainty has a minimal influence on the institutional investors and corporate innovation investment. The conclusions obtained from this study provide empirical evidence for giving full play to the role played by institutional investors in corporate innovative development. The conclusions also reveal, from the macroscopic level, that the consistency and stability of governmental economic policies have important effects on corporate development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic policy uncertainty; Innovation investment; Institutional investor","","","","Acknowledgments: This study was supported by the Outstanding Youth Project of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China (20B326), the construct program of the applied characteristic discipline – Applied Economics in Hunan Province (2018469) and the General Project of Hunan Social Science Achievement Evaluation Committee (XSP21YBC193).","Aggarwal, Reena, Does governance travel around the world?

COVID-19 has caused economic disruption at an unprecedented speed and scale. The economic costs it will bring to society can only be measured in times to come. Millions of people across the globe have already become unemployed, and similarly, millions of businesses have either shut down or are on the verge of collapse. It is a great challenge for policymakers to minimize the economic impact of COVID-19 and put the economy on a growth trajectory once again. Unfortunately, there is so far no country in the world that can be viewed as a role model for its economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study proposes Islamic finance as a potential tool to help affected economies safely pass through the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic. This study identifies a four-stage COVID-19 model and proposes ten innovative Islamic financial services for each stage of the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: After documenting historical developments in currency systems, the study reviews the Islamic perspective on the matter. Features of an ideal currency system are listed and then a critical evaluation of existing currency systems – fiat, banking and cryptocurrency – is undertaken. Findings: It is found that existing currency systems – fiat, banking and cryptocurrency – are not compatible with the socio-economic objectives of a forward-looking, progressive society, which upholds transparency and justice as its core values. The study documents that Sharīʿah norms have no preference or dislike for any of the existing currency systems. Any prudent currency system compatible with the objectives of the Islamic financial system (i.e. stability and equitable distribution of wealth) is acceptable. A single international reserve currency (with country-specific legal tendering) is subject to the risk of destabilisation across global markets. Practical implications: This paper recommends autonomy of central banking, the spending of seigniorage for the welfare of community members, development of asset-backed currencies (following ṣukūk structures), as well as multiple international reserve currencies and joining of hands by professionals and Sharīʿah scholars to design a currency system compatible with the Islamic financial system. This paper’s recommendation is against the adoption of cryptocurrency that lacks the backing of real assets. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by evaluating the compatibility of existing currency systems in the achievement of socio-economic objectives of a welfare state which seeks to uphold justice and equitable resource distribution as core values in the financial system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Fiat currency; International currency; Islamic currency","","","","","Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Corr, (2016); Seisense Journal of Management, (2018); International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration, (2017); Journal of Islamic Economics Banking and Finance, (2016); Ajouz, Mousa, Developing a Sharīʿah-Compliant Precious Metal Backed Cryptocurrency, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 33, 1, pp. 3-20, (2020); Frequently Asked Questions, (2018); Innovation and Authenticity in Islamic Finance, (2008); Islam and the Economic Challenge, (1992); Islamic Economic Studies, (1996)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","22894365; 01281976","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097814181"

Currently, more than 37 gold-backed cryptocurrency companies have now emerged. Interestingly, some of them also claim to be Sharīʿah-compliant. Introducing precious metal-backed cryptocurrencies is perceived to be an innovation among global payment systems, hampered in part by lack of supporting empirical evidence. Therefore, this research investigates potential users' tendency to adopt a Sharīʿah-compliant precious metal-backed cryptocurrency. As such, this study adopts an extended adoption model, which consists of eight factors. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was conducted on data elicited from economic active residents in Klang Valley from questionnaires. Overall, it was found six out of the eight constructs specified to influence the adoption of precious metal-backed cryptocurrency were statistically significant where 54.5% of the variation in adoption of PMBC can be explained by the structure model provided by this research.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative methodology is used in conducting this research where relevant literature on ṣukūk was reviewed. Through a doctrinal approach, the paper presents analyses on the practice of ṣukūk and ṣukūk on blockchain by discussing its legal, Sharīʾah and regulatory issues. This culminates in a conceptual analysis of blockchain ṣukūk and its peculiar challenges. Findings: This paper reveals that digitizing ṣukūk issuance through blockchain remedies certain inefficiencies associated with ṣukūk transactions. Indeed, structuring ṣukūk on a blockchain platform can increase transparency of underlying ṣukūk assets and cash flows in addition to reducing costs and the number of intermediaries in ṣukūk transactions. The paper likewise brings to light legal, regulatory, Sharīʾah and cyber risks associated with ṣukūk on blockchain that confront investors, practitioners and regulators. This calls for deeper collaboration in research among Sharīʾah scholars, lawyers, regulators and information technology experts. Research limitations/implications: As a pioneering subject, the paper notes the prospects of blockchain ṣukūk and the current dearth of literature on it. The paper would assist relevant Islamic capital market entities and authorities to determine the potential and impact of blockchain ṣukūk in their respective businesses and the financial system. Practical implications: Blockchain ṣukūk will assist in addressing issues inherent in classical ṣukūk and in paving the way to innovative solutions that will facilitate and enhance the quality of ṣukūk transactions. For that, ṣukūk would require appropriate regulatory technology to address its governance and regulation peculiarities. Originality/value: Integrating ṣukūk with blockchain technology will add value to it. The paper advances the idea that blockchain ṣukūk revolutionises ṣukūk and enhances its practice against known inadequacies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Blockchain technology; Legal issues; Regtech; Regulatory issues; Sharīʾah; Ṣukūk","","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by QRC plc and IBH, Research Grant number IF057A-2018.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by QRC plc and IBH, Research Grant number IF057A-2018.

The implication of such a system is the emergence of many socio-economic problems. Restoring the value of money has long been a controversial topic, hampered in part by the lack of theoretical and empirical evidences. Therefore, this research aims to develop a Sharīʿah-compliant precious metal backed crypto-currency (PMBC) mechanism. To achieve this, a general product development process is adopted, which consists of four phases involving planning, concept development, system-level design, and testing. In addition, Sharīʿah scholars and financial experts were interviewed to validate the mechanism theoretically. The result of this research was to introduce a Sharīʿah-compliant PMBC where the description and the modus operandi of the PMBC were presented. This research defined PMBC as a digital currency, backed by precious metals that uses strong cryptography. It is designed to fulfill all the functions of money in accordance with Sharīʿah while operating as a peer-to-peer payment system. Overall, it was found that all the resources needed to develop and implement PMBC are already available. The scholars and experts interviewed supported the implementation of PMBC, but there are a variety of challenges and reservations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cryptocurrency; precious metal; Sharīʿah-compliant","","","","","Shariah Standard, (2017); Certified Sharia Adviser and Auditor, (2018); International Business Research, (2015); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2013); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2013); Abdullah, Adam, Examining the value of money in Turkey over the long term (1469-2009), Asian Social Science, 9, 17, pp. 187-208, (2013); Abdullah, Adam, Economic security requires monetary and price stability: Analysis of Malaysian macroeconomic and credit data, Al-Shajarah, 20, Specialissue, pp. 205-247, (2015); Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Islamic Currency, (2016); Askari, Hossein G., 100 percent reserve banking and the path to a single-country gold standard, Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, 19, 1, pp. 29-64, (2016)","","King Abdulaziz University Scientific Publishing Center","","","","","","16584244; 10187383","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097806936"

Many people perform transactions related to vehicles in their daily life; transportation authorities also perform vehicle transactions as part of managing vehicle fleets. But tracking these transactions is a challenging task. There are countrywide solutions that uses centralized systems. However, these solutions have problems with trust management, transparency, and access control. Therefore, we believe there is still room for integrated automation of various vehicle-related transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based framework for vehicle tracking that incorporates the mentioned features. Moreover, blockchain is customized to enable usage control for additional transactions, such as inspection, renting and islamic insurance. The usage control model is integrated with IoT devices to continuously monitor the vehicles for certain conditions and remotely revoke access if needed. The complete transaction set is recorded over an immutable ledger that provides trust, transparency and a complete history of record. In this paper, we also presents a prototype implementation of a permissioned blockchain, which will be made available under the GNUv3 General Public License.

The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of Islamic Fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other FinTech users.

To address this question, we examine a set of technologies that have received increasing industry, media, and scholarly attention over the past decade: blockchains. Harnessing the concepts of ‘moral economy’ and ‘scandal’, we identify both possibilities and limits for blockchain applications to legitimate a range of monetary and investment activities. However, we also find that a persistent individualisation of responsibility for failures and shortcomings with ‘live’ blockchain experimentation has undermined the potentially legitimating aspects of this technology. Combining a reliance on technological fixes with a persistent individualist moral economy, we conclude, works against efforts to confront head-on the tensions underpinning the on-going legitimacy crises facing finance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; cryptocurrency; digital money; legitimacy; scandal; technology","","","","We are grateful for feedback received from the two journal reviewers and editors, as well as participants in the the 2018 Finance and Society Network Conference in Edinburgh and the 2018 European Workshop in International Studies on 'Wrongdoing, International Scandal, and the Politics of Responsibility'.

The fundamental difference between the two forms of risk mitigation is entrenched from the type of contract selected. The conventional insurance work on the principle of bilateral contracts between the customer (insured) and insurance provider where the insured pay regular premium in return for payment of compensation, in case of a predefined event occurs. On the other hand, Takaful works on the principle of mutual guarantee, cooperation and indemnity where the participants in the scheme mutually insure each other. The Takaful providers are mainly responsible for managing, administering and investigating the Takaful funds according to Islamic laws. This studies provides a decentralized architecture that securely implements Takaful risk mitigation system according to its principles.
