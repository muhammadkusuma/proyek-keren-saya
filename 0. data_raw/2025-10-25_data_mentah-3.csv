Using quantitative analysis of 400 respondents in Tangerang city, the findings show that digital zakat adoption is more dominant among the 18-34 age group and respondents with a bachelor’s degree or higher education. This group is more prepared to use digital platforms because of better access to technology and a greater understanding of its benefits. However, digital literacy gaps and limited access remain major challenges, particularly for older adults and low-income communities. The findings highlight that technology adoption, zakat ecosystem strengthening, and community involvement significantly influence operational efficiency and transparency in zakat management. This research contributes to the literature on zakat digitalization and offers strategic recommendations for zakat institutions to optimize technology adoption, emphasizing an inclusive approach that considers the demographic characteristics of users. Collaboration among zakat institutions, the government, and technology providers is essential to ensure successful technology integration and to meet the public’s demand for more transparent and efficient zakat services. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital literacy; digital zakat; sustainable; technology adoption","","","","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Directorate of Research, Technology, and Community Service (DRTPM) for providing research grant funding in 2024.

However, many MSMEs struggle with financial management, hindering their growth and access to financing. The implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards for Micro, Small, and Medium Entities (SAK EMKM) was introduced to simplify financial reporting for MSMEs. This study explores the adoption of SAK EMKM at Mutiara Laundry, a case study MSME, to assess its effect on financial transparency, decision-making, and access to external funding. The research highlights challenges such as limited financial literacy and reliance on informal accounting methods. The findings suggest that implementing SAK EMKM enhances financial management and facilitates financing opportunities. The study recommends improving financial literacy and utilizing digital tools to support MSMEs. This research contributes to the understanding of how SAK EMKM can aid MSMEs in improving financial management and long-term sustainability. Practical Implications: The findings of this study highlight that implementing financial statements based on SAK EMKM can significantly enhance the financial management capabilities of micro and small enterprises, such as Mutiara Laundry UMKM. Proper adoption enables business owners to maintain accurate and standardized records, making it easier to monitor performance, control costs, and plan for growth. It also enhances credibility with financial institutions, increasing opportunities for obtaining loans or investments. Social Implications: The adoption of SAK EMKM in micro and small enterprises like Mutiara Laundry UMKM fosters broader social benefits beyond individual business performance. Standardized and transparent financial reporting fosters trust among MSMEs, customers, suppliers, and financial institutions, thereby contributing to the development of stronger local economic ecosystems. Improved financial literacy among small business owners empowers them to make better decisions, sustain their operations, and create more stable employment opportunities in the community. Originality/Value: This study offers a practical contribution by examining the implementation of financial statements based on SAK EMKM in a real-world microenterprise context, using Mutiara Laundry UMKM as a case study. While SAK EMKM is intended to simplify financial reporting for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, empirical research on its adoption in specific service-sector businesses remains scarce. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial management; financing; MSMEs; SAK EMKM; transparency","","","","","Susanto, Sugeng, Measuring The Influence of The Central Business District Development of SDGs on The Growth and Income of People Affected by The Development of The New Nusantara Capital City, International Journal of Accounting and Economics Studies, 12, 4, pp. 447-454, (2025); Aldehayyat, Jehad S., The use of strategic planning tools and techniques by hotels in Jordan, Management Research Review, 34, 4, pp. 477-490, (2011); Ardiansyah, Misnen, ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF POSITIVE ACCOUNTING THEORY: A STUDY OF ISLAMIC BANKING IN INDONESIA, Asian Economic and Financial Review, 12, 6, pp. 380-396, (2022); Iqtishoduna Jurnal Ekonomi Islam, (2023); International Research Journal of Management IT and Social Sciences, (2019); Harun, Harun, Indonesian public sector accounting reforms: Dialogic aspirations a step too far?, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 28, 5, pp. 706-738, (2015); Conference Proceedings, (2017); Dinasti International Journal of Economics Finance Accounting Dijefa, (2024); Hoang, Thinh Gia, Business intelligence and analytic (BIA) stage-of-practice in micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 36, 4, pp. 1080-1104, (2023); Journal, (2025)","","Malque Publishing","","","","","","26751240","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016691319"

This adoption plays a vital role in advancing specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), by fostering financial inclusion, enhancing digital financial literacy, and enabling equitable access to Fintech education through smartphones. Qualitative data was collected via an online survey distributed through social media platforms and emails, allowing for a broad and inclusive reach. The questionnaire targeted the overall public, or mobile phone users in Jordan, with no age restriction, to achieve diverse opinions regarding mobile-based financial literacy and Fintech adoption. One hundred eighty-nine valid responses were obtained, forming the basis for statistical analysis. The study explores the direct correlations between educational initiatives facilitated by smartphones and the subsequent adoption of Fintech services, considering the moderating effects of digital literacy and the regulatory environment. The results show that increased digital literacy enhances the effectiveness of Fintech applications, thus promoting financial inclusivity and literacy. The structural model explains 75.4% of the variance in smartphone usage for financial education (R2 = 0.754). Hypothesis testing confirms significant positive effects, with Fintech adoption (β = 0.033, p < 0.001), educational outreach (β = 0.040, p < 0.001), and innovation in educational Fintech products (β = 0.043, p < 0.001) associated with increased smartphone usage in education. The study highlights the need for advancements in user-friendly and accessible financial services, underlining the critical role of regulatory frameworks and digital literacy in fostering a secure and inclusive financial ecosystem.

In fact, Islamic finance has a variety of advantages compared to conventional, and has a variety of instruments that can be developed. One of the innovations in the development of Islamic financial instruments is the combination of sukuk and waqf or called sukuk linked waqf. The development of waqf-linked sukuk is one of the innovations and a manifestation of the importance of formulating objectives derived from religious and divine values or known as the Tawhidi String Relation (TSR). The TSR approach emphasizes the truth that comes from God, while at the same time emphasizing the importance of trying to achieve the benefit of the world. The principle of TSR is the oneness of Allah SWT which is known as Tawhid which acts as the main method for the development of Islamic finance. The oneness of Allah SWT is represented in the Al-Qur’an which is then juxtaposed with As-Sunnah. Based on the TSR approach, this paper suggests that there are many arguments or basic arguments for the importance of returning the financial sector back to the sharia economy which originates from the Al-Qur’an and As-Sunnah. This weak correlation causes the innovation results in the ecosystem for the development of waqf-linked sukuk to be weak. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Islamic financial conclusion which must truly base its ecosystem on the basis of the Al-Qur’an and As-Sunnah as the foundation for the development of sukuk linked waqf. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entrepreneurial Growth; Islamic Finance; Sharia Economy; Tawhidi String Relationship; Waqf Linked Sukuk","","","","","Tifbr Tazkia Islamic Finance and Business Review, (2023); Jebis Jurnal Ekonomi Dan Bisnis Islam, (2021); Indonesian Journal of Business Accounting and Management, (2021); Ascarya, Ascarya, Proposed model of integrated Islamic commercial and social finance for Islamic bank in Indonesia, Eurasian Economic Review, 12, 1, pp. 115-138, (2022); Al-Hawary, Sulieman Ibraheem Shelash, Multiobjective optimization of a hybrid electricity generation system based on waste energy of internal combustion engine and solar system for sustainable environment, Chemosphere, 336, (2023); Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Studies, (2022); Lestari, Sri, Impact of Self-Efficacy and Work Discipline on Employee Performance in Sociopreneur Initiatives, APTISI Transactions on Technopreneurship, 6, 2, pp. 270-284, (2024); Sundara Advanced Research on Artificial Intelligence, (2025); Haas, Peter M., Prospects for implementing the SDGs, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 56, (2022); Sharia Oikonomia Law Journal, (2024)","","Pandawan Sejahtera","","","","","","26568888; 26558807","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017879364"

The study mainly investigates how incorporating ESG into SE can improve transparency, accountability, and overall business performance. Data were collected from 211 members, including employees, customers, investors, suppliers, CSR managers, and industry experts, through a mixed-methods approach. The research advances to the development of the ESG research body by illustrating the clear business benefits of integrating sustainable practices into corporate strategy. The novelty of the study builds on a new understanding of ESG integration by linking risk identification, stakeholder loyalty, and organizational profitability, understanding the influence of ESG on business. The findings suggest that improvements in SE that are sustainable practices in ESG lead to increased transparency and accountability (TA) within organizations. Active engagement generates benefits for both organizations and communities, strongly impacting both environmental and social impacts (ESI). Strong ESG development builds strong relationships with investors and identifies risks earlier. Integrating ESG into CSR activities increases business value through customer loyalty. The result shows that ESG integration, as previously stated, not only improves corporate social influence but also contributes to over time business sustainability and profitability. The study demonstrates that incorporating ESG into CSR practices fosters organizational resilience, transparency, and stronger stakeholder trust. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accountability; Corporate social responsibility; Customer loyalty; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable business practices; Transparency","Economic and social effects; Human resource management; Investments; Profitability; Sales; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Accountability; Business practices; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Customer loyalty; Organisational; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable business; Sustainable business practice; Sustainable practices; Transparency; accountability; business; corporate social responsibility; environmental impact; governance approach; social impact; stakeholder; sustainable development","","","","Synergistic Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on Human Resource Management the Mediating Role of Employee Well Being and the Moderating Influence of Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives, (2025); Evolving Role of Corporate Governance in Shaping Business Practices and Legal Accountability in the 21st Century, (2025); Legal Compliance in Corporate Governance Frameworks Best Practices for Ensuring Transparency Accountability and Risk Mitigation Accountability and Risk Mitigation, (2025); Annesi, Nora, Navigating paradoxes: building a sustainable strategy for an integrated ESG corporate governance, Management Decision, 63, 2, pp. 531-559, (2025); Bahta, Dawit, Corporate social responsibility, innovation capability and firm performance: evidence from SME, Social Responsibility Journal, 17, 6, pp. 840-860, (2020); Chen, Ying, Industry Heterogeneity and the Economic Consequences of Corporate ESG Performance for Good or Bad: A Firm Value Perspective, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 15, (2024); Accounting and Finance Studies, (2025); Advances in Applied Accounting Research, (2024); Risk Assessment and Integration Strategies, (2024); Dinh, Van Thanh Thi, Factors Associated With ESG Investment Attitude, Financial Planning Review, 8, 1, (2025)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","15729893; 03432521","","GEOJD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017710440"

The research employs a descriptive case study methodology using field data and adopting a juridical-empirical approach. Data collection is conducted through observation, interviews, and documentation, while data analysis encompasses data condensation, presentation, and conclusion. The findings indicate that the resilience of Islamic boarding schools in developing Sharia economic law stems from recognizing and strengthening their institutional autonomy. This includes acknowledging the roles of religious leaders, students, and the broader community in developing the pesantren-based Sharia economy. As centers of Sharia economic study and business practice, Islamic boarding schools are poised to serve as pivotal models in translating Sharia economic theory into practice. To enhance their role in this domain, several alternative solutions are proposed: firstly, the formulation of supplementary regulations emphasizing the study of economic law; secondly, the promotion of Islamic boarding schools as exemplars in fostering a Sharia economy within society; thirdly, the integration of Sharia economic law theory into the curriculum to optimize human resource development; and fourthly, the establishment of Islamic boarding schools as Sharia business laboratories capable of engaging in collaborative ventures. The contribution of this study lies in demonstrating how pesantren serve as contextual actors that bridge Islamic jurisprudence and socio-economic practice, offering a model for integrating fiqh al-muʿāmalāt into contemporary legal frameworks. This enriches academic discourse on Islamic law contextualisation while providing practical insights for policymakers, educators, and practitioners in strengthening Sharī ʿah economic governance in Indonesia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic Boarding School; Resilience; Sharia Economic Law","","","","The authors express their gratitude to State Islamic University (UIN) Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Indonesia, for academic support and facilities that enabled the completion of this study.

Survey data from 350 SME executives were analyzed through Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that AF and SIL are positively related to a firm's sustainable performance through FTA. Furthermore, FC positively moderates the relationship between AF, FTA, and the firm's sustainable performance. Findings show that AF, SIL, FTA, and FC are fundamental resources that are associated with sustainable performance in all three domains: Environmental (ESP), social (SSP), and financial (FSP) performance.

Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, we developed a model to assess the factors influencing decision-makers' intention to adopt GenAI as a substitute for entry-level jobs in financial institutions. To test the hypotheses, we collected survey data from 335 respondents in Malaysian financial institutions and analyzed it using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that trust in GenAI significantly affects decision-makers' intention to adopt it as an alternative solution to human positions. Trust, in turn, was found to be positively influenced by constructs from the Theory of Effective Use (transparent interaction, informed action, and representational fidelity) as well as AI literacy, which reflects users' ability to evaluate and interact with AI. The results also show that personality traits, particularly conscientiousness, moderate the relationship between trust and adoption intention, highlighting the importance of individual differences in GenAI usage. Collectively, our findings extend the S-O-R framework by revealing how both cognitive and affective factors shape GenAI adoption behavior. The study also offers practical implications for GenAI stakeholders, especially about the vital role of trust-building strategies in fostering AI adoption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entry-level jobs; Generative AI; Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R); Theory of Effective Use (TEU)","Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Decision makers; Entry-level job; Financial institution; Generative AI; Malaysians; Partial least-squares; Personality traits; Stimulus-organism-response; Survey data; Theory of effective use; Decision making; artificial intelligence; decision making; organization; technological development; workplace; Malaysia","","","","Agarwal, Pragati, Artificial Intelligence Adoption in the Post COVID-19 New-Normal and Role of Smart Technologies in Transforming Business: a Review, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, 15, 3, pp. 506-529, (2024); Ali, Muhammad, How perceived risk, benefit and trust determine user Fintech adoption: a new dimension for Islamic finance, Foresight, 23, 4, pp. 403-420, (2021); Ariño-Mateo, Eva, The level of conscientiousness trait and technostress: a moderated mediation model, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 11, 1, (2024); Arpaci, Ibrahim, Understanding the social sustainability of the Metaverse by integrating UTAUT2 and big five personality traits: A hybrid SEM-ANN approach, Technology in Society, 71, (2022); Bajunaied, Kholoud, Behavioral intention to adopt FinTech services: An extension of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 9, 1, (2023); Bawack, Ransome Epie, Exploring the role of personality, trust, and privacy in customer experience performance during voice shopping: Evidence from SEM and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, International Journal of Information Management, 58, (2021); Becker, Jan Michael, PLS-SEM’s most wanted guidance, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 35, 1, pp. 321-346, (2023); Impact of AI Literacy on the Emotional Reaction to AI Mistakes in Human AI Collaboration Bachelors Thesis, (2024); Bharti, Swaraj S., Customer acceptability towards AI-enabled digital banking: a PLS-SEM approach, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 28, 4, pp. 779-793, (2023); Bhaskar, Preeti, Shall I use ChatGPT?

This study delves into the downside risk contagion between innovative technology assets (e.g., AI, Metaverse, Fintech), energy markets (e.g., oil, natural gas), gold, and conventional markets (e.g., stocks, bonds) from July 2018 to December 2023. Using advanced econometric techniques, the research uncovers critical insights into market behavior during turbulent times. The results reveal a significant increase in market connectedness during crises, particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, strong connectedness is observed among innovative technology sectors, while weaker links are evident between bond and technology markets. Furthermore, natural gas exhibits weak connectivity with other markets, highlighting its potential for diversification. Another key finding shows that natural gas and Bitcoin emerge as the riskiest assets, while gold, AI, and Metaverse maintain more stable tail risk profiles over time. These findings offer valuable insights for investors, financial advisors, and portfolio managers navigating volatile market environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Commodities; Cryptocurrency; Downside risk; Metaverse","","","","","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Dynamic effect of Bitcoin, fintech and artificial intelligence stocks on eco-friendly assets, Islamic stocks and conventional financial markets: Another look using quantile-based approaches, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 192, (2023); Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Quantile price convergence and spillover effects among Bitcoin, Fintech, and artificial intelligence stocks, International Review of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-205, (2023); Abdul-Rahim, Ruzita, Benefit–Risk Perceptions of FinTech Adoption for Sustainability from Bank Consumers’ Perspective: The Moderating Role of Fear of COVID-19, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, Asymmetric connectedness between Google-based investor attention and the fourth industrial revolution assets: The case of FinTech and Robotics & Artificial intelligence stocks, Technology in Society, 68, (2022); Ali, Shoaib, Dynamic Tail Risk Connectedness between Artificial Intelligence and Fintech Stocks, Annals of Operations Research, (2024); Al-Nassar, Nassar S., In search of hedges and safe havens during the COVID─19 pandemic: Gold versus Bitcoin, oil, and oil uncertainty, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 90, pp. 318-332, (2023); Alshater, Muneer Maher, Early warning system to predict energy prices: the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Annals of Operations Research, 345, 2, pp. 1297-1333, (2025); Antonakakis, Nikolaos, Refined Measures of Dynamic Connectedness based on Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressions, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 13, 4, (2020); Arfaoui, Nadia, Return and volatility connectedness between gold and energy markets: Evidence from the pre- and post-COVID vaccination phases, Economic Analysis and Policy, 77, pp. 617-634, (2023); Barredo-Arrieta, Alejandro, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Information Fusion, 58, pp. 82-115, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0927538X","","PBFJE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008548568"

Since there is a dearth of literature on Islamic corporations, this study highlights the need for additional research on this topic. A new paradigm for future research was identified by reviewing the literature from 2014-2024. Publish or Perish (PoP) was used to gather the data, which were then organized according to the citation count. Visualizations and bibliometric analysis were aided by the VOSviewer program application. Research into Islamic corporate and financial literacy has slowed significantly over the last decade, peaking in 2021. The 151 items related to the two topics were grouped into 10 clusters out of the 998 papers identified. In particular, Islamic corporations adhere to sharia principles that stress the importance of fulfilling social responsibilities for the benefit of society. Stakeholders can gain a better understanding of financial literacy.

A total of 546 responses were collected across 13 Malaysian states via stratified random sampling and analysed using PLS-SEM. Results show that effort expectancy, social benefit, openness to change, and attitude significantly influence intention. Attitude also mediates the effects of performance and effort expectancy, economic and social benefit, regulatory support, and openness to change on intention. In contrast, social influence, and perceived security and privacy risks had no significant effect on attitude or intention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate UTAUT, meta-UTAUT, and VAM into a unified model for FinTech payment adoption.

Meanwhile, the level of IF has positive and significant impact towards housing affordability because it will cause a drop or increase in the purchasing power of households, as well as a decline or increase in the capability to own a house. Research limitations/implications – The most significant aspects to consider when analysing housing affordability in Malaysia are demand and supply. However, this study focuses on only five variables and only covers Malaysia. As a result, future researchers should analyse the study’s location, such as by region or district, and include additional variables from both the demand and supply sides. Homeownership of affordability requires a broader and more realistic definition in the current context of a more disruptive environment where technology such as fintech, blockchain and the internet of things acts as enablers for not only promoting homeownership but also ensuring homeownership sustainability. As a result, democratising Islamic home financing appears to be a viable option that requires rethinking, and further research is recommended. Practical implications – The study proposes an end-to-end solution to promote homeownership levels by considering the level of RR as significant variables among stakeholders such as the house buyers/owners, sellers, investors as well the government agencies in influencing affordability in Malaysia. Originality/value – This paper discusses the indicators of housing affordability index over the 21-year period of 2000–2020, covering all states in Malaysia. The comparison of affordability level can be seen through all states and by regions. Besides that, the findings revealed that RR and IF have a positive and significant impact towards housing affordability. RR is considered an essential variable in promoting homeownership in Malaysia and warrants further investigation towards policy implication. This paper also provides contribution on data on RR by states in Malaysia that can be used by policymakers to some extent. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Homeownership; Housing affordability; Islamic economy; Islamic home financing; Rental rate","","","","","International Journal of Property Science, (2017); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2017); Bank of Finland Discussion Papers, (1998); Policy Options for Stimulating Private Sector Investment in Affordable Housing Across Australia, (2001); Physiol Behav, (2025); International Journal of Trade Economics and Finance, (2015); Clark, William A.V., Entry to home-ownership in Germany: Some comparisons with the United States, Urban Studies, 34, 1, pp. 7-19, (1997); 15th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey, (2018); Bis Quarterly Review, (2004); Flavin, Marjorie A., Owner-occupied housing and the composition of the household portfolio, American Economic Review, 92, 1, pp. 345-362, (2002)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17590825; 17590817","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177070581"

The primary objective is to develop a low-cost, automated tree CAD modeling methodology combined with blockchain functionalities to support smart forest projects and collaborative design processes. The proposed method utilizes a parametric tree CAD model consisting of four 2D tree-frames with a 45° division angle, enriched with recorded tree-leaves’ texture and color. An “AI Text-by-Voice CAD Programming” technique is employed to create tangible tree-model NFT tokens, forming the basis of a thematic “Internet-of-Trees” blockchain. The main results demonstrate the effectiveness of the blockchain/Merkle hash tree in tracking tree geometry growth and texture changes through parametric transactions, enabling decentralized design, data validation, and planning intelligence. Comparative analysis highlights the advantages in cost, time efficiency, and flexibility over traditional 3D modeling techniques, while providing acceptable accuracy for metaverse projects in smart forests and landscape architecture. Core contributions include the integration of AI-based user voice interaction with blockchain and behavioral data for distributed and collaborative tree modeling, the introduction of a scalable and secure “Merkle hash tree” for smart forest monitoring, and the facilitation of fintech adoption in environmental projects. This framework offers significant potential for advancing metaverse-based landscape architecture, smart forest surveillance, sustainable urban planning, and the improvement of citizen involvement in sustainable forestry paving the way for a greener future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain functionalities; citizen involvement in sustainable forestry; collaborative greener future; landscape modeling behavioral; smart forest fintech adoption","","","","We would like to acknowledge the support of the Department of Forest & Natural Environment Sciences, Democritus University of Thrace (Greece).","Dimitriadis, Konstantinos A., Exploring the dynamic nexus of traditional and digital assets in inflationary times: The role of safe havens, tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies, Economic Modelling, 151, (2025); Liu, Jingyang, Spatial–Temporal Pattern of Coordination between the Supply and Demand for Ecosystem Services in the Lhasa River Basin, Land, 13, 4, (2024); Peng, Ruixin, Digital Financial Inclusion and Inclusive Green Growth: Evidence from China’s Green Growth Initiatives, International Journal of Financial Studies, 13, 1, (2025); McCormick, Kes B., Advancing sustainable urban transformation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 50, pp. 1-11, (2013); Varveris, Dimitrios, Tree Architecture & Blockchain Integration: An off-the-shelf Experimental Approach, WSEAS Transactions on Environment and Development, 19, pp. 969-977, (2023); Brandín, Roberto, IoT-BIM and blockchain integration for enhanced data traceability in offsite manufacturing, Automation in Construction, 159, (2024); Sharma, Ram P., Modelling individual tree height–diameter relationships for multi-layered and multi-species forests in central Europe, Trees - Structure and Function, 33, 1, pp. 103-119, (2019); Yazdi, Hadi, A Target-driven Tree Planting and Maintenance Approach for Next Generation Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI), Journal of Digital Landscape Architecture, 2023, 8, pp. 178-185, (2023); Fox, Nathan, A Collaborative Augmented Reality Decision Support System for Crowdsourcing Urban Designs, Journal of Digital Landscape Architecture, 2023, 8, pp. 195-202, (2023); Li, Dandan, Use of terrestrial laser scanning to obtain the stem diameters of Larix olgensis and construct compatible taper-volume equations, Trees - Structure and Function, 37, 3, pp. 749-760, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","26741032","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017164663"

In this domain, a question has been raised: In BCA strategies, is there any correlation between SEP performance and ECEAs and DEISIs in a mediating role? A serial mediation model was tested on a dataset of 630 WB and EU companies, and the research conceptual model was validated by CFA (Confirmation Factor Analysis), and the SEM (Structural Equation Model) fit was assessed. We found a statistically sound (significant, positive) correlation between BCA and ESG success performance, especially in the innovation and integrity ESG performance success indicators, when DEISIs mediate. The findings confirmed the influence of technology, and environmental, cultural, ethnic, and social factors on BCA strategy. The findings revealed some important issues of BCA that are of worth to WB companies’ managers to address BCA for better performance. This study adds to the literature on corporate blockchain transformation, especially for organizations seeking investment opportunities in new international markets to diversify their assets and skill pool.

It focuses on 26 listed Islamic and conventional banks across 11 countries in the MENA and Southeast Asia regions between 2020 and 2024. To measure digital adoption, we create a seven-component FinTech Adoption Index. We use fixed-effects regressions to examine its impact on cost efficiency, profitability, solvency stability, and credit risk. This analysis also controls bank size, capitalization, and macroeconomic conditions. The results show a clear adoption gap. Conventional banks consistently score 0.5–0.8 points higher on the FinTech Index compared to Islamic banks. Each additional FinTech component raised operating costs by about 0.8%, but improved profitability slightly by only 0.03%. This suggests that technological integration creates upfront costs before any real efficiency gains are seen. However, the stability benefits are stronger. FinTech adoption increases the Z-score by 3.6 points and lowers the non-performing loan ratio by 0.1%. Islamic banks gain more stability benefits due to their risk-sharing contracts and asset-backed financing structures. Overall, an efficiency–stability trade-off emerges. Conventional banks focus more on profitability, while Islamic banks gain resilience, but face slower efficiency improvements. By combining the Resource-Based View and Financial Stability Theory, this study provides the first multi-country evidence of how governance structures shape digital transformation in dual-banking markets. The findings offer practical guidance for regulators and bank managers around balancing innovation, efficiency, and stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; conventional banking; dual banking; efficiency; FinTech; Islamic banking; MENA; stability","","","","This study did not receive any special grant from public, commercial, or not-for-profit funding agencies.

To ensure effective planning and investment, charitable organizations must recognize the fundraising methods likely to expand in the coming years and take into account the key drivers and risks that significantly influence these trends. Based on a literature review and expert interviews, 62 fundraising methods, 7 drivers, and 10 risks were initially identified, then refined and prioritized using the Delphi method and TOPSIS ranking.The key trends expected to shape the future of fundraising include crowdfunding-based approaches, engagement with high-net-worth donors, the promotion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) partnerships, and the expansion of stock market-based fundraising. The primary drivers identified are technological adoption, enhanced transparency, and impact assessment, while major risks include administrative corruption, reduced social capital, and economic instability. This study is the first to focus on the methods, drivers, and risks of fundraising in Iranian charities, taking into consideration the country’s cultural, religious, and economic context.

As a result, many rely on insecure informal systems, which results in user dissatisfaction in the long run. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, powered by blockchain technology, offer a promising alternative by enabling fast, low-cost, and highly secure transactions without the need for traditional banking institutions. This study empirically investigates how cryptocurrency adoption can enhance financial inclusion in Indonesia, both directly and indirectly through mediating factors such as user satisfaction, trust in financial institutions, and perceived economic empowerment. The study explores whether cryptocurrency use fosters financial autonomy, strengthens trust in digital financial services, and increases satisfaction with financial technologies—factors that may encourage broader participation in the formal financial system. Data were collected through a Google Form survey involving 147 respondents, Indonesian cryptocurrency investors. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, results reveal that while cryptocurrency adoption significantly improves user satisfaction, trust in the financial system, and economic empowerment, with scores of 0.888, 0.732, and 0.851, respectively. Cryptocurrency adoption also has a direct effect on financial inclusion, with a score of 0.635. However, perceived economic empowerment emerged as a strong mediating variable, with a score of 0.556 to financial inclusion, compared to user satisfaction with a mediating score of 0.282 to financial inclusion. These findings highlight that high economic empowerment is a key value driver for crypto investors. The results show platforms emphasizing accessibility, security, and transparency may be better positioned to support financial inclusion in emerging economies like Indonesia, without having to engage in a formal financial system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Investor; Partial Least Squares; Path Model; Trust in Financial Institutions","","","","The APC of this research was funded by Yayasan Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia (YPPI).","Abbasi, Ghazanfar Ali, The adoption of cryptocurrency as a disruptive force: Deep learning-based dual stage structural equation modelling and artificial neural network analysis, PLOS ONE, 16, 3 March 2021, (2021); Implementing the Digital Economy Enabling Environment Guide A Case Study from Indonesia, (2021); 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, (2021); 6th International Conference on Advanced Research in Arts Science Engineering Technology, (2021); Cao, Huining (Henry), Fintech, financial inclusion, digital currency, and CBDC, Journal of Finance and Data Science, 9, (2023); Global Findex Database 2017 Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution, (2018); Journal of Injury and Violence Research, (2011); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., Re-examining the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT): Towards a Revised Theoretical Model, Information Systems Frontiers, 21, 3, pp. 719-734, (2019); European Union Institute for Security Studies, (2021); El Amri, Mohamed Cherif, Analysis of Fatwas on FinTech, pp. 73-90, (2021)","","Centre for Research on Islamic Banking and Finance and Business","","","","","","26878518; 2687850X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015103240"

It promotes predictability and fairness in legal relations, establishing a framework for balancing private and public interests. In countries with transitional legal systems, such as Ukraine, property rights and contractual mechanisms face additional challenges as the global economy continues to evolve. Given the difficulties outlined above, there is a pressing need for research into how legal systems adjust to the ever-changing political, social, and economic climates. Property expectations are essential for public policy, economic Stability, and legal accountability. This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of existing studies on legally controlled expectations of property, with a particular focus on works published between 2019 and 2024. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework utilized in this study ensures openness and completeness of the process for selecting, excluding, and reviewing relevant material. Research was limited by the review scope, which included only peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and conference papers, ensuring the quality and credibility of the SLR. The findings of this study highlight research gaps, particularly in relation to socio-environmental factors and legislative changes in transition economies. In contrast, the current study emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach to address existing gaps.

Although numerous conventional models, such as SERVQUAL, have been widely used to measure service quality, they have also been criticized in general for their inability to document industry specifics and to reflect the evolving expectations of airline customers. To address these constraints, many authors have developed alternative methodologies that can be better adapted to the complicated context of the airline industry. This paper analyses established and evolving airline service quality models, scrutinizing the strengths, limitations, and implications of the models in the airline industry today. The paper adds to the current literature on the theoretical foundations and criticisms of service quality models, contributing to the continued improvement of service quality assessment instruments. Particular emphasis is placed on delineating the impact of service quality on satisfaction, behavioral loyalty, and psychological variables, such as price elasticity and perceptions of value. The findings of this study reveal the strategic role of service quality as a competitive advantage, especially in mature, price-sensitive markets. It suggests that a more defined, context-specific evaluation framework will help airlines to more closely match their level of service delivery with customer expectations. Overall, this paper recommends the development of more holistic and context-specific models to improve service quality measurement, facilitate strategic planning, and manage customer relationships in the airline industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Disclosure; Carbon Footprint; Displacement Matrix; Return Index","","","","","International Journal of Heritage Tourism and Hospitality, (2018); Journal of Law and Emerging Technologies, (2022); International Journal of Doctrine Judiciary and Legislation, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The constitutional framework for public policy in the Middle East and North Africa countries, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 7, 3, pp. 187-203, (2021); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, E-procurement in the international experience: an approach to reduce corruption in administrative contracts in Egypt, International Journal of Procurement Management, 15, 3, pp. 340-364, (2022); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, Policies and legal framework of involving small and medium enterprises in administrative contracts in Egypt: dynamics and influences, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 9, 1, pp. 61-74, (2022); Russian Law Journal, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The legal framework and policies for sustainable administrative contracts in Egypt: reality and challenges, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 9, 2, pp. 111-129, (2023); Central European Management Journal, (2023); Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023)","","Science Publishing Corporation Inc.","","","","","","23094508","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015193031"

This study examines the disclosure practices of Romanian-listed companies regarding accounting estimates, their correlation with financial performance, ESG scores, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Financial data was gathered from annual reports and those regarding the use of AI on companies’ websites. Financial performance was measured through profitability and liquidity indicators. The results of the statistical regressions showed that company size can influence AI disclosure; however, industry is not a strong predictor, and the number of employees does not significantly influence AI disclosure. A positive relationship was found between AI transparency and the current ratio, suggesting that companies disclosing more information about their AI use may have higher current liquidity. Additionally, a statistically significant negative relationship was observed between the AI disclosure score and net profit, indicating that greater AI transparency is associated with lower net income. The results of interaction analysis proved that there may be a relationship between ESG exposure and financial performance when considering AI disclosure. However, this result may be considered controversial in a more conservative analysis, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and multidimensional approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","accounting estimates; artificial intelligence disclosure; corporate performance; ESG scores; financial reporting quality","Artificial intelligence; Finance; Personnel; Sustainable development; Transparency; Accounting estimate; Artificial intelligence disclosure; Business models; Corporate performance; ESG score; Financial performance; Financial reporting; Financial reporting quality; Romanians; Sustainable values; Profitability","","","The APC was funded by the West University of Timi\u0219oara.","Journal of Economics Business and Management, (2016); Nguyen, Thai Hoang, Do narrative-related disclosures in the annual report enhance firm value?

There is a serious environmental problem since the number of building and demolition sites has increased faster than the availability of efficient waste management options. Putting this concrete debris in landfills is dangerous for people, animals, and the environment. To solve this problem, researchers performed a thorough Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to effectively evaluate the environmental effects of landfilling against those of recycling concrete debris. The purpose of the analysis was to determine the financial impacts of different waste management strategies. By ISO 14040:2006, a systematic LCA procedure was used to conduct the research. We utilized the EcoInvent 3.4 database and the SimaPro 8.5.2.0 program to streamline the LCA steps and provide clearer outcomes. Damage prices linked with different environmental consequences were also calculated using the Handbook of Environmental Prices 2017. Damage cost and Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) comparisons show that recycling is much more costeffective than landfilling. The former has been demonstrated to have much greater impacts on the environment than the latter, which involves recycling and transporting concrete debris. The importance of this research lies in its provision of LCA conclusions related to concrete waste management solutions, including landfilling, recycling, transportation, and the advancement of modeling methodologies for calculating damage costs. It draws attention to the critical need for more environmentally friendly methods of waste management and provides helpful insights into those methods' effects on the natural world. This study suggests identifying crucial impact indicators and management methods with significant environmental impacts. In addition, a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) might be performed to support the results by calculating the savings from using various concrete waste management techniques. In conclusion, Dubai has a significant difficulty with its growing concrete waste problem due to the city's rapid infrastructure development. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) that compare landfilling versus recycling emphasize the necessity of sustainable waste management. This research not only improves our knowledge of damage cost modeling but also provides a thorough analysis of potential solutions for dealing with concrete waste, which can help guide policymakers toward more effective responses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete Waste; Damage Cost; Dubai; Financial; Infrastructural Growth; Life Cycle","","","","","Journal of Law and Emerging Technologies, (2022); Resources Conservation and Recycling, (2014); International Journal of Doctrine Judiciary and Legislation, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The constitutional framework for public policy in the Middle East and North Africa countries, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 7, 3, pp. 187-203, (2021); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, E-procurement in the international experience: an approach to reduce corruption in administrative contracts in Egypt, International Journal of Procurement Management, 15, 3, pp. 340-364, (2022); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, Policies and legal framework of involving small and medium enterprises in administrative contracts in Egypt: dynamics and influences, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 9, 1, pp. 61-74, (2022); Russian Law Journal, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The legal framework and policies for sustainable administrative contracts in Egypt: reality and challenges, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 9, 2, pp. 111-129, (2023); Central European Management Journal, (2023); Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023)","","Science Publishing Corporation Inc.","","","","","","23094508","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013994608"

This study addresses critical challenges in cloud security by proposing a novel framework that integrates blockchain-based smart contracts to enhance authorization and authentication processes. Smart contracts, as self-executing agreements embedded with predefined rules, enable decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof mechanisms for managing access control in cloud environments. The proposed system mitigates prevalent threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and identity theft through an immutable and auditable security framework. A prototype system, developed using Ethereum blockchain and Solidity programming, demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Rigorous evaluations reveal significant improvements in key metrics: security, with a 0% success rate for unauthorized access attempts; scalability, maintaining low response times for up to 100 concurrent users; and usability, with an average user satisfaction rating of 4.4 out of 5. These findings establish the efficacy of smart contract-based solutions in addressing critical vulnerabilities in cloud services while maintaining operational efficiency. The study underscores the transformative potential of blockchain and smart contracts in revolutionizing cloud security practices. Future research will focus on optimizing the system’s scalability for higher user loads and integrating advanced features such as adaptive authentication and anomaly detection for enhanced resilience across diverse cloud platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","authentication; authorization; blockchain technology; cloud security; decentralized access control; smart contracts","Anomaly detection; Blockchain; Cloud platforms; Cloud security; Decentralized control; Scalability; Smart contract; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Cloud securities; Cloud services; Critical challenges; Decentralized access control; Robust access control; Security mechanism; Service demand; Unauthorized access; Authentication","","","This study is supported by Department of Information Technology, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, 71491, Saudi Arabia.","Khalil, Usman, Leveraging a novel NFT-enabled blockchain architecture for the authentication of IoT assets in smart cities, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Taherdoost, Hamed, Smart Contracts in Blockchain Technology: A Critical Review, Information (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2023); Jiang, Fan, Enhancing Smart-Contract Security through Machine Learning: A Survey of Approaches and Techniques, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2023); Karagwal, Shreya, Blockchain for Internet of Things (IoT): Research Issues, Challenges, and Future Directions, EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing, pp. 15-34, (2023); Migration Letters, (2023); Ethics in A Digital World Ab Magazine, (2023); Reyes, Alvaro, Continuous and Secure Integration Framework for Smart Contracts, Sensors, 23, 1, (2023); Pasqua, Michele, Enhancing Ethereum smart-contracts static analysis by computing a precise Control-Flow Graph of Ethereum bytecode, Journal of Systems and Software, 200, (2023); Play and Games for Transformational Innovation in the Ontario Healthcare System, (2020); Alevizos, Lampis, Blockchain-Enabled Intrusion Detection and Prevention System of APTs Within Zero Trust Architecture, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 89270-89288, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013348663"

The study applied the comparative legal method to compare the norms of Kazakh and international legislation in the field of insurance. Formal-legal and systemic approaches were used to analyse the structure and content of legal acts regulating InsurTech products. The legal modelling method made it possible to substantiate the prospects for the development of financial and legal regulation taking into account the digital transformation of the insurance market. The study analysed in detail the essence of InsurTech as the integration of digital technologies into the insurance industry, which identified key areas of industry transformation, including smart contracts, automated risk assessment and personalised digital products. A study of the current state of legal regulation of insurance activities in the Republic of Kazakhstan revealed a number of gaps, in particular, the lack of normative consolidation of concepts related to digital insurance services, as well as insufficient flexibility of legal mechanisms to respond to technological changes. As a result of the analysis of international experience, it was found that the EU and the US have introduced specialised regulatory regimes, such as “regulatory sandboxes”, which allow testing digital insurance products under controlled conditions with minimal regulatory burden. Mechanisms such as the FinTech Regulatory Sandbox and InsurTech Innovation Hub have been considered to provide regulatory flexibility while maintaining an appropriate level of consumer protection. The analysis showed that such initiatives facilitate the accelerated integration of innovations into the insurance sector and can be adapted to the Kazakh context, taking into account local legal and institutional peculiarities. Based on the comparative analysis, recommendations for Kazakhstan were proposed, including the development of legal definitions, expanding the functionality of the financial supervisory agency in terms of InsurTech, as well as the introduction of a legal mechanism of “regulatory sandbox” in order to stimulate innovation while respecting the requirements of legal certainty and consumer protection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; automated risk assessment systems; blockchain technologies; digital identification; digital technologies; insurance law","","","","","Report of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation and Development of Financial Market for the Year 2023, (2024); Bulletin of the Institute of Legislation and Legal Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan, (2022); Allianz Risk Barometer, (2024); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Charpentier, Arthur, Artificial intelligence and personalization of insurance: Failure or delayed ignition?, Big Data and Society, 12, 1, (2025); Chatzara, Viktoria, FinTech, InsurTech, and the Regulators, AIDA Europe Research Series on Insurance Law and Regulation, 1, pp. 3-25, (2020); undefined, (1999); Cornelli, Giulio, Regulatory Sandboxes and Fintech Funding: Evidence from the UK, Review of Finance, 28, 1, pp. 203-233, (2024); undefined, (2025); Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council no 2016 97 on Insurance Distribution Recast, (2016)","","Lviv State University of Internal Affairs","","","","","","26174162; 26174170","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012865761"

Despite the economic potential of spices such as cardamom and clove, smallholder farmers remain marginalized in price negotiations, bound by informal credit schemes and buyer-controlled market structures. Grounded in the framework of Islamic economics, which emphasizes justice (‘add) and prohibits exploitation (shikar), this research explores how these unethical practices persist and affect farmers’ livelihoods. Using a qualitative descriptive method, data were collected through semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and analysis of local trade documents involving 30 stakeholders: farmers, collectors, and village officials. The findings reveal a pervasive system of price suppression, enforced dependency, and income instability, exacerbated by asymmetric information and power dynamics. Such arrangements not only hinder market fairness but also contradict Islamic ethical norms on transparency, voluntary exchange, and mutual benefit. The study contributes to the literature by integrating Islamic moral economy with empirical analysis of rural market behav-ior. It proposes actionable strategies, including local price regulation (tastier), cooperative-based collective bargaining, and sharia-compli-ant financing models to restore justice and empower producers.

In parallel, debates surrounding its permissibility under Islamic law have intensified. The lack of legal clarity among Islamic scholars presents a significant challenge in providing normative guidance. The fatwa issued by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) declaring cryptocurrency haram (unlawful) has drawn criticism for being misaligned with contemporary concepts of maslahah and the evolving digital economy. This study critically examines the MUI's prohibition through the lens of Al-Tufi's human cognition-based theory of maslahah alongside contemporary Muslim scholars who assess legal rulings through contextual considerations of harm (mafsadah) and benefit (maslahah). This research is a literature-based study employing a normative-juridical approach and qualitative analysis, exploring the fatwa through the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, maslahah, and maqasid al-shari'ah while drawing on both classical and contemporary Islamic thought. The findings reveal that the MUI fatwa, based on four legal grounds—gharar (speculation), darar (harm), qimar (gambling), and sil'ah (tradable commodity)—and a rigid textual approach, fails to incorporate a human cognition-based maslahah as a viable alternative to support regulatory clarity and an adaptive formulation of Islamic law responsive to digital innovation.

Using monthly data from 2019-2023, the research employed multiple linear regression analysis followed by dynamic systems modeling to assess fund sustainability. The regression results show that GDP growth and exchange rates positively influence hajj fund assets (p<0.05), while BI-7 Day Reverse Repo Rate, inflation, and Jakarta Islamic Index negatively affect fund assets. Dynamic system simulations reveal that under current conditions (ROI 6.78%, subsidy portion 40%), hajj funds will face deficit by 2030. However, optimistic scenarios with increased ROI to 10% and reduced subsidy portions to 20% ensure fund sustainability until 2050, with assets reaching IDR 569 trillion. These findings suggest that BPKH should enhance investment portfolio returns while the government should reconsider subsidy allocation policies to ensure long-term sustainability of hajj fund management in Indonesia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate; Gold Price; Inflation; Liabilities; Oil Price","","","","","Ben Amar, Amine, On the role of Islamic banks in the monetary policy transmission in Saudi Arabia, Eurasian Economic Review, 12, 1, pp. 55-94, (2022); Asimeng, Emmanuel Theodore, Why do paratransit operators resist participation in bus rapid transit?

However, the traditional management still faces challenges, such as limited transparency and public participation reach. Digitization through fintech with crowdfunding modeling was considered capable of increasing donor participation while improving the effectiveness of management and distribution. This research aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the development of cash waqf, mapping the trends, identifying the main factors influencing its development, and exploring gaps, particularly in the context of integration with crowdfunding models. The process led to the adoption of performance analysis and science mapping methods. Performance analysis was conducted descriptively to measure productivity and impact through bibliometric indicators. Science mapping was used to review the research landscape by analyzing the relationships and structures of topics, authors, and relevant institutions. It was also used to identify collaboration patterns, thematic focuses, including under-researched areas, and integration with crowdfunding platforms. The results showed that regulatory aspects, contemporary digital technology innovations, and the role of Islamic financial institutions were factors influencing the development of cash waqf research. Topic modeling analysis proved that the exploration on the integration of cash waqf and crowdfunding was limited. This led to a gap in research on the governance of digital waqf platforms, as well as strategies to enhance public participation through technology.

Cloud technologies are an integral part of digital innovations that these institutions use in their activities. These technologies are in active development and adaptation to the specifics of the functioning of different financial intermediaries, in particular commercial banks. The article pays special attention to the study of using cloud technologies in the work of banking institutions, taking into account the specifics of their economic activity and their role in the development of the financial system and the national economy. For this purpose, the key characteristics of using cloud technologies are determined, and the specific features of the economic activity of commercial banks are substantiated, taking into account the possibilities of using artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, the role of cloud computing technologies in the modern development of banking institutions in the informational security system was analyzed. To understand the ambiguity of the consequences of using cloud technologies and the positive and negative consequences of their use in the work of commercial banks, the research was conducted. As a result, it is established that cloud technologies already today are already indispensable components of the development of any commercial bank. Thanks to their application using the potential of digital technologies and, in combination with the construction of effective systems, digital transformation is possible, to ensure high-level competitiveness and dynamic, regulated bank development in the conditions of digitalization of economic relationships and change of established models functioning of the financial market services. The article formulates promising directions for the use and adaptation of cloud technologies by commercial banks, taking into account their opportunities and threats. It is also determined that the gradual growth of demand from these institutions for relevant services will contribute to the emergence of new changes in the cloud services market, taking into account their capabilities to form such demand and the scale of their activities, which also determine the need to build effective information systems for their work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","banking institution; banking service; cloud technologies; digital technology; digitalization; financial services market","","","","This research is carried out within the framework of the scientific project \u201CModel of post-war development of credit institutions based on artificial intelligence: customization of financial services and prudential supervision\u201D with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.","Journal of Lifestyle and Sdgs Review, (2024); Afgani, Kurnia Fajar, Risk Management Practices and the Performance of Indonesian and Malaysian Islamic Banks: Does Digitalization Mediate This Nexus?, Thunderbird International Business Review, 66, 6, pp. 567-581, (2024); Ambekar, Archana M., Shaping society 5.0 with smart banking solutions over cloud: Need, impacts, and technology, pp. 593-616, (2025); Ayadi, Rym, Digitalization and banks' efficiency: Evidence from a European analysis, International Review of Financial Analysis, 97, (2025); Bassens, David, Banking in the cloud: mapping big tech’s global digital technology networks, Regional Studies, 58, 12, pp. 2241-2255, (2024); Begimkulov, Emil, The Impact of Bank Competition on Stability in Central Asia: The Moderating Role of Bank Digitalization, Public Finance Quarterly, 71, 1, pp. 87-106, (2025); Biswas, Ankur, Decentralized Cloud Banking: Empowering Security and Efficiency with Blockchain, IPFS, and Smart Card Technology, International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering, 12, 3s, pp. 31-47, (2024); Li, Chengming, DIGITALIZATION AND THE “TOO BIG TO FAIL” DILEMMA: MECHANISMS AND ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS OF BANKS’ FINTECH INNOVATION ON TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 30, 2, pp. 464-488, (2024); Cloud Computing in Banking Things to Consider When Moving to the Cloud; Cui, Qi, The Impact of Digitalization via Broadband Expansion on Bank Transparency, SAGE Open, 15, 2, (2025)","","Precarpathian National University","","","","","","24132349; 23110155","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010262183"

Originating from decision theory, systems thinking, and complexity science, it supports informed judgment in uncertain environments. Despite its broad application, previous research on accounting and auditing reforms has predominantly concentrated on stable economies, with minimal emphasis on countries recovering from conflict. This study examines the future trajectories of accounting and auditing practices in post-war Ukraine using a scenario analysis framework. Data were collected through the Delphi method, incorporating expert interviews and survey questionnaires. Analytical techniques included the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), supplemented by bootstrapping for result validation. The analysis reveals that Scenario 1, referred to as ""Digital Reinvention,"" has a statistically significant impact on the projected development of accounting and auditing in Ukraine's post-war context. In contrast, Scenarios 2 and 3, labeled ""Gradual Compliance"" and ""Regulatory Stagnation,"" do not exhibit significant associations with the evolution of the field. The findings indicate that the three exogenous variables together explain approximately 41.2% of the total variance in the endogenous variable, demonstrating a moderate predictive capacity of the model. This suggests that Ukraine’s post-conflict financial landscape is likely to be influenced predominantly by digital transformation, institutional modernization, full adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the implementation of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies to enhance financial transparency and audit reliability in the emerging economic environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Transformation; Auditing; Auditing Methodologies; Economic Resilience; Financial Transparency; Forecast; Post-Conflict Recovery; Ukraine","","","","","Post War Reconstruction in Ukraine within Corporate Finance Framework Un Sdg Aspect, (2024); Bašić, Sanela Cekic, Social Work in a Post-war Dystopia: A Case Study of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Journal of Human Rights and Social Work, 9, 3, pp. 410-417, (2024); Bolesta, Andrzej, From socialism to capitalism with communist characteristics: the building of a post-socialist developmental state in Central Asia, Post-Communist Economies, 34, 1, pp. 71-98, (2022); Blythe, Jessica L., Fostering ocean empathy through future scenarios, People and Nature, 3, 6, pp. 1284-1296, (2021); Futurity Economics Law, (2021); Castleberry, Ashley N., Thematic analysis of qualitative research data: Is it as easy as it sounds?, Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning, 10, 6, pp. 807-815, (2018); Cordova-Pozo, Kathya Lorena, Types of scenario planning and their effectiveness: A review of reviews, Futures, 149, (2023); Edwards, Robert D., Technical analysis of stock trends, Eleventh edition, pp. 1-638, (2018); Eichhorn, Theresa, Exploring macro-environmental factors influencing adoption of result-based and collective agri-environmental measures: a PESTLE approach based on stakeholder statements, Bio-based and Applied Economics, 13, 1, pp. 49-71, (2024); Complexity in Economics, (2024)","","Centre for Research on Islamic Banking and Finance and Business","","","","","","26878518; 2687850X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011582429"

Specifically, it examines the antecedent factors influencing users’ intentions to adopt and use FinTech services during this unprecedented period. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research method approach with partial least squares-structural equation modelling was used to test the research proposed model. Findings: The results of the structural path revealed that the drivers of behavioural intentions to use FinTech services are perceived usefulness, perceived self-efficacy, perceived vulnerability, subjective norms, perceived severity, perceived certainty and resistance to use and these factors explain 79.5% of the variance of behavioural intention. Research limitations/implications: This study identifies key factors for FinTech acceptance in Jordan, offering actionable insights for policymakers and service providers. Building user trust in service and technology (security, effectiveness and transparency) is crucial, alongside leveraging social influence (testimonials, endorsements) and boosting awareness/knowledge through campaigns and educational initiatives. This study identifies key factors for FinTech acceptance in Jordan, offering actionable insights for policymakers and service providers. Building user trust in service and technology (security, effectiveness and transparency) is crucial, alongside leveraging social influence (testimonials, endorsements) and boosting awareness/knowledge through campaigns and educational initiatives. This study’s generalizability is limited by its sample, drawn from three Jordanian regions and dominated by potential users. Comparing actual and potential user perceptions, alongside including users from diverse contexts (e.g. other developing countries), could address this. In addition, using qualitative methods alongside the quantitative approach and exploring indirect relationships (mediating/moderating) would provide richer insights into FinTech acceptance in Jordan. Originality/value: While prior research has explored FinTech adoption, including studies conducted in Jordan, this study makes several key contributions. Firstly, it specifically examines FinTech trends within the post-COVID-19 era in Jordan, a period marked by accelerated digital transformation and evolving user behaviours. Secondly, it extends existing models of FinTech adoption by incorporating “perceived self-efficacy, perceived vulnerability, subjective norms, perceived privacy, perceived severity, perceived value, perceived certainty and resistance to use”, in addition to the established factors of “perceived usefulness and ease of use”. This expanded model provides a more holistic understanding of the drivers and barriers to FinTech adoption in this context. Finally, this research provides empirical evidence from the Jordanian market, offering valuable insights for financial institutions and policymakers seeking to promote FinTech adoption and financial inclusion in a developing economy undergoing rapid digital change. This focus on the post-pandemic Jordanian context, combined with the extended theoretical model, offers a novel contribution to the literature. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19 pandemic; Financial technology; FinTech growth; Information technology; Innovative technologies; Technology acceptance","","","","The author would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers of the Foresight Journal for taking the necessary time and effort to review the manuscript.

Design/methodology/approach: The deductive approach was used based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). The data were collected by an electronic questionnaire that was prepared based on several previous studies, obtaining 527 responses. Structural equation modeling was used by SmartPLS software to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Findings: This study reached a set of results, the most important of which was that each of the compatibility, security and perceived trust affects the contracts of the TAM (behavioral intention, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness) except the effect of security on behavioral intention. Research limitations/implications: This study focused on identifying the opinions of the respondents from the general community and was not limited to a specific segment. On the other hand, despite identifying the demographic characteristics of the respondents, this study did not test the impact of these characteristics on the intention to use digital currency. Practical implications: This study is expected to help financial institutions in general to understand the future behavior of community members toward dealing with Bitcoin and to make decisions regarding how to direct the financial policy in the country; in addition, it will also contribute to educating the citizens of countries about the risks related to this currency. Originality/value: The survey of previous studies revealed a significant decrease in this study of the behavior of individuals in Arab societies in general toward dealing with Bitcoin and in Iraq in particular, forming a spatial gap. The results of this study are expected to help improve community members’ dealings with digital currency based on their perceptions of trust, security and compatibility.

This study investigates the role of Sharia governance in mitigating legal, operational, and reputational risks associated with e-wallets and explores its implications for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 8, which emphasizes decent work and economic growth. Using a qualitative approach and secondary data analysis, the study examines Sharia governance frameworks, compliance challenges, and oversight mechanisms, including the role of the Sharia Advisory Board, periodic audits, and transparency in fund management. Findings reveal that robust Sharia governance reduces compliance uncertainties, enhances consumer trust, and stabilizes the industry. Furthermore, systematic governance in e-wallets directly supports SDG 8 by fostering financial inclusion, creating decent job opportunities, and driving sustainable economic growth. The study emphasizes the need for standardized Sharia compliance protocols, regular audits, and collaboration between regulatory bodies and e-wallet providers to ensure effective and consistent adherence to Islamic principles.

Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic generalized method of moments was used to study the influence of time orientation in 45 countries from 2012–2020 in the main analysis. Fixed-Effect Model was applied for the regional analysis. Findings: Results indicate the existence of a significant effect of “time orientation” on Islamic finance. In regional comparison analysis, time orientation is not significant in some regions, such as non-Asian and Arab countries. The market is very limited in non-Asian countries, while similarities in scope between Islamic and conventional finance reduce the long-term orientation in Arab countries. Practical implications: Improving the time orientation of weak countries enhances the industry’s status in those countries and pushes it to compete with the leading countries in the industry. Culture is a comprehensive framework that includes all factors located within it. While governance is imposed through regulation and procedures and raises the cost of business, culture is integral and built-in, and thus it is less expensive, and its presence is stronger, facilitating the applications of Islamic finance.

The development of this industry is influenced by ongoing efforts to harmonize DSN-MUI fatwas with OJK regulations, aiming to enhance Sharia compliance and legal certainty. Through DSN-MUI fatwas (2008–2021) and POJK regulations (2016, 2022), religious and state authorities have worked to enhance legal certainty and consumer protection in the Sharia-based digital finance sector. This study adopts a qualitative approach through literature-based document analysis to examine how DSN-MUI fatwas and OJK regulations contribute to developing the Sharia FinTech industry. The research findings indicate that while fatwas offer normative guidance for Sharia compliance, challenges persist in areas such as financial literacy, technological readiness, and regulatory oversight effectiveness.

AI includes the development of trading bots, the implementation of automated risk management systems, and the use of predictive analytics tools that optimize trading operations. This is important, as AI technology plays a crucial role in the rapid analysis of huge amounts of data to predict market prices and trading opportunities, thereby increasing the efficiency of investments. In addition, AI provides investors with real-time information and assists in risk management. However, there are objective difficulties, and crypto fraudsters study different scenarios and adapt to changing market conditions using AI. By using the methods of observation, generalization, systematization and comparison, the authors have achieved results in determining the significance of implementation. In particular, the integration of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies can be applied, which aims to use the capabilities of big data processing and continuous learning to create a more efficient trading environment and financial services. The results presented in this paper give grounds to assert that it is possible to implement in the real business and technological environment (exchanges, crypto-exchanges, cryptocurrency operations, IT infrastructure, big data, AI). The article proposes innovative models and applications of artificial intelligence for use in trading business operations, where the main tool for users is generative artificial intelligence and interfaces. This method makes it possible to define generative artificial intelligence and natural language interfaces as the main means for trading operations that will be carried out using cryptocurrencies. As a result, real-time cryptocurrency trading and investment strategies based on data and algorithms have become possible. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; blockchain technology; crypto fraud; cryptocurrency projects; smart contract automation; trading; trading bots","","","","","AI Powered Cryptocurrency the Future of Blockchain AI Trading and Investment Strategies, (2025); International Journal of Applied Science and Engineering Ijase, (2021); Journal of Jurisprudential and Legal Research, (2023); undefined; Krichen, Moez, Blockchain for Modern Applications: A Survey, Sensors, 22, 14, (2022); Kalajdjieski, Jovan, Databases fit for blockchain technology: A complete overview, Blockchain: Research and Applications, 4, 1, (2023); Chong, Felicia Hui Ling, Enhancing trust through digital Islamic finance and blockchain technology, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 13, 3, pp. 328-341, (2021); Ces 2025 AI Advancing at Incredible Pace Nvidia Ceo Says, (2025); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., Artificial Intelligence (AI): Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy, International Journal of Information Management, 57, (2021); Categories to Watch for in Crypto X AI Agents Examples","","Technology Center","","","","","","27065448; 26649969","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011855125"

This situation can help crypto assets to be environmentally friendly while keeping costs within a reasonable range. Accordingly, in this study, it is aimed to find the most essential innovation and knowledge-based criteria for the improvement of the green crypto assets. Within this context, a new model is generated by integrating different techniques. DEMATEL approach is adopted to facing expressions, quantum theory and Spherical fuzzy sets. Similarly, a comparative evaluation is also performed by using M-SWARA methodology. In the final part of the decision-making model, artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-making approach is taken into consideration to rank 4 alternative strategies with respect to the green crypto asset investments. Additionally, a comparative examination is also made with TOPSIS technique for ranking these alternatives. On the other side, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by considering 6 different cases. The main contribution of this study to the literature is that a novel AI-based decision-making model is constructed to find appropriate investment strategies for the improvement of the green crypto assets. AI technique is integrated to the fuzzy decision-making theory. This situation has an important impact on the management of the uncertainty in an effective way. With the help of this issue, both methodological originality can be increased and more appropriate evaluations can be conducted. The findings indicate that technical support plays the most crucial role for the improvement of green crypto assets. Hence, for the purpose of making crypto assets environmentally friendly, it is necessary to invest in technology first. Owing to this situation, it will be possible to achieve cost-effectiveness of clean energy projects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost effectiveness; DEMATEL; Environmental issues; Facial expression; Green crypto assets; Spherical fuzzy sets","","","","","Ai, Rui, Investigating the components of fintech ecosystem for distributed energy investments with an integrated quantum spherical decision support system, Financial Innovation, 9, 1, (2023); An, Jaehyung, Analysis of energy projects financial efficiency and renewable energy generation in russia, Finance: Theory and Practice, 25, 5, pp. 79-91, (2021); An, Jaehyung, Current Waste Management in banks from 11 asian Countries vs sberbank esG Reporting, Finance: Theory and Practice, 27, 6, pp. 173-184, (2023); An, Jaehyung, Relationship between the popularity of a platform and the price of NFT assets, Finance Research Letters, 61, (2024); An, Jaehyung, Financial and Investment Model for social security and sustainable Economic Growth, Finance: Theory and Practice, 28, 5, pp. 133-145, (2024); Angelini, Eliana, Clean energy indices and brown assets: an analysis of tail risk spillovers through the VAR for VaR model, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, (2022); Multidimensional Strategic Outlook on Global Competitive Energy Economics and Finance, (2022); Book of Crypto the Complete Guide to Understanding Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets, (2022); Awan, Usama, Quantum computing challenges in the software industry.

This systematic literature review (SLR) examines several studies on PPPs related to infrastructure development in various countries. Analysis was conducted on 69 scholarly articles published between 2009 and 2024 to synthesize key themes, research methodologies, and geographical trends in PPP studies. The findings from SLR are helpful in understanding the relationship between PPP and infrastructure development, economic growth, and institutional strengthening. A major part of SLR covers three regions of Asia–Pacific, particularly China and India. The review identifies critical gaps: insufficient frameworks for assessing social and environmental impacts, ineffective risk management strategies, and inadequacies in stakeholder engagement. This study underscores the importance of governance mechanisms and collaborative approaches in enhancing PPP effectiveness. This review points out existing research and further opportunities for future research to help policymakers, practitioners, and academics unlock the benefits of PPPs for sustainable development. Recommendations include robust tools for assessments, improved governance frameworks, and interdisciplinary approaches capable of tackling the many complexities involved in PPP implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Public private partnership (PPP); Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable investment","","","","","Adebayo, Abimbola A., Indicators, Strategies, and Rule Settings for Sustainable Public–Private Infrastructure Partnerships: From Literature Review towards Institutional Designs, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 12, (2023); Agarchand, Nilesh, Sustainable infrastructure development challenges through PPP procurement process: Indian perspective, International Journal of Managing Projects in Business, 10, 3, pp. 642-662, (2017); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, Public–private partnerships for sustainable infrastructure development in Ghana: a systematic review and recommendations, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 12, 2, pp. 237-257, (2023); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, Mapping Studies on Sustainability in the Performance Measurement of Public-Private Partnership Projects: A Systematic Review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2022); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, Critical managerial measures on financial risks of sustainable public–private partnership projects: a PRISMA review, Journal of Financial Management of Property and Construction, 28, 3, pp. 398-422, (2023); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, Fuzzy Analysis of Financial Risk Management Strategies for Sustainable Public–Private Partnership Infrastructure Projects in Ghana, Infrastructures, 9, 4, (2024); Almarri, Khalid, Critical success factors for public–private partnerships in smart city infrastructure projects, Construction Innovation, 25, 2, pp. 224-247, (2025); Alqahtani, Fahad K., Appraising critical success factors in sustainable housing projects: A comparative study of PPP modalities in Saudi Arabia, Heliyon, 10, 12, (2024); Amiri, Omid, Risks of water and wastewater PPP projects: an investors’ perspective, Construction Innovation, 22, 4, pp. 1104-1121, (2022); Anwar, Bilal, Sustainable urbanization and development goals strategy through public-private partnerships in a South-Asian metropolis, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","00335177; 15737845","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218795982"

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of 78 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Web of Science published between 2018 and 2024, the study uncovers regulatory inconsistencies across regions, including (under Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations), ASEAN (through OJK’s gold mandate), and Saudi Arabia, thereby impeding the international adoption of blockchain technology for Shariah compliance. While blockchain technology enhances transparency and compliance through smart contracts, it also introduces cybersecurity risks and conflicts with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Furthermore, Shariah compliance continues to be a subject of contention, with Saudi Arabia raising concerns regarding the classification of intangible assets. In this regard, the review proposes the implementation of an AI-driven liquidity model framework, advocating for a tiered regulatory approach in advanced economies and the establishment of central bank safeguards in emerging markets, while ensuring ethical considerations. By leveraging GBCs, stakeholders can unlock their potential as an inclusive and resilient financial instrument.

The aim of the research is to analyse and explain how these disruptions affect financial performance indicators, such as Return on Assets (ROA), company stability, and market value. The research employed a panel data model, where the dependent variable is the financial performance of the companies and disruptions in accounting are the independent variables. The data were collected from publicly available financial statements, audit reports, and macroeconomic indicators. The study applied a fixed-effect and random-effect regression model to measure the relationship between disruptions in accounting and financial indicators. Company size, industry type, and other macroeconomic conditions (e.g., Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth) are control variables. Disruptions in accounting have a significant negative impact on financial performance, including restatements, reporting delays, and qualified audit opinions, which causes a decrease in ROA.

The research focuses on three primary determinants: demographic characteristics, knowledge of digital assets, and the perceived risks associated with their usage and transfer. Utilizing a quantitative research design, data were collected from 630 Thai respondents via a structured online questionnaire through convenience sampling. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify statistically significant predictors. The results indicate that digital-asset knowledge, gender, age, income, saving behavior, and risk perception collectively account for a substantial variance in individuals’ intentions to use digital assets as part of their inheritance planning. Notably, knowledge and income positively influence adoption, suggesting that financial education and broader economic development may encourage increased usage. Conversely, factors such as age, gender, and perception of risks pose significant barriers, underscoring the need for targeted strategies to foster inclusivity. As digital assets transition from speculative tools to recognized financial instruments, their role in inheritance planning becomes increasingly relevant.

However, despite numerous studies on blockchain applications, a knowledge gap exists in understanding its comprehensive impact on financial reporting processes and the development of integration models with other digital technologies. The aim of the study is to determine the impact of blockchain technologies on the processes of preparing and submitting financial statements, as well as determining the prospects for using this technology in accounting in the digital age. The research employed the following methods: content analysis of modern blockchain systems, comparative analysis of financial indicators of companies that use blockchain, as well as economic and statistical modelling. The impact of blockchain technologies was assessed through quantitative analysis, including descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman coefficients), regression analysis, cluster analysis and hypothesis testing (t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test). The calculations were performed using SPSS, Stata, and Python software (Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn). The results confirm that the implementation of blockchain technologies increases the efficiency of financial reporting, reducing operating costs by 15–20% and reducing audit costs by 25–30%. Smart contracts minimize errors by 18%, and the average processing time for financial transactions decreased from 48 to 5 hours. In the financial sector, costs were reduced by 30%, and transaction processing time by 85%. The academic novelty of the study lies in the comprehensive analysis of the application of blockchain technologies to increase the transparency and reliability of financial reporting in a global context, as well as the creation of new knowledge through statistical analysis and practical assessment of blockchain's effectiveness. The prospects for further research include the development of models for integrating blockchain with other digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data, as well as assessing the long-term economic consequences of using blockchain in the financial sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automation; Blockchain; Digital Accounting; Financial Reporting; International Standards; Smart Contracts; Transparency","","","","","Rawashdeh, Awni, Bridging the trust gap in financial reporting: the impact of blockchain technology and smart contracts, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 23, 2, pp. 660-679, (2025); Accounting Auditing and Finance, (2022); Fahdil, Husam Nawfal, Blockchain Technology in Accounting Transforming Financial Reporting and Auditing, Journal of Ecohumanism, 3, 5, pp. 216-233, (2024); Bellucci, Marco, Blockchain in accounting practice and research: systematic literature review, Meditari Accountancy Research, 30, 7, pp. 121-146, (2022); Smith, Sean Stein, Blockchain and accounting governance: emerging issues and considerations for accounting and assurance professionals, Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, 17, 1, pp. 119-131, (2020); Public Accounting and Sustainability, (2024); Dyball, Maria Cadiz, Client use of blockchain technology: exploring its (potential) impact on financial statement audits of Australian accounting firms, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 35, 7, pp. 1656-1684, (2022); Fayvishenko, Diana S., Communication Strategies of Brand Management and Online Marketing of Digital Products, Economic Affairs (New Delhi), 68, 1, pp. 289-298, (2023); Prokopenko, Olha V., Improving customer relations in the banking sector of Ukraine through the development of priority digital banking products and services: Evidence from Poland, Banks and Bank Systems, 17, 3, pp. 12-26, (2022); Gai, Weidong, Financial Automation Audit Method Based on Blockchain Technology, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022)","","Little Lion Scientific","","","","","","19928645; 18173195","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006942760"

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the NARDL recently developed by Shin et al. (2014) to estimate the long and short-run relationships between the variables rather than the widely known ARDL (Pesaran et al., 2001), which suffers from a complex structure in the estimation equation that usually includes lags and differences in both short and long terms. The implementation of NARDL required several proceedings after plotting the descriptive data, commencing with unit root tests, selection of lag length, estimating the long-and-short variables coefficients, heteroscedasticity test and Wald test for symmetries. Findings: The long-run estimations of the positive and negative asymmetric coefficients indicate that cryptocurrencies capitalization has a negative impact on bank deposits in the UAE. Further, the short-run estimations coefficients exhibit that both significant positive and negative partial sum squares of cryptocurrencies decrease bank deposits. Research limitations/implications: The study has applied to the UAE spanning the period 2005M1–2020M4 using the NARDL. Practical implications: The short-run estimations coefficients exhibit that both significant positive and negative partial sum squares of cryptocurrencies decreases bank deposits, which means that the increase in the magnitude of cryptocurrencies capitalization stimulates depositors and speculators to adjust their portfolios towards contracting their deposits in banks to invest partially in cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, the decline in cryptocurrencies capitalization process spur depositors and speculators to reduce their deposits for purchasing cryptocurrencies at lower prices. Social implications: The study infers that individuals and businesses are cautious when investing in cryptocurrencies, and they need more certainty and trust to include these types of assets in their portfolios. The fluctuation in cryptocurrencies capitalization prompts speculators to change their deposits according to the cryptocurrencies' prices. Originality/value: This study explores the short-and long-run asymmetric impacts of cryptocurrencies capitalization development on bank deposits volatility in the UAE, based on a NARDL, for providing a manifest depiction of whether the cryptocurrencies industry might be a threat to conventional banking system performance in the potential future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank deposits; Cryptocurrencies; Nonlinear autoregressive distributive lag; Short- and long-run relationships; UAE","","","","","Alkhazaleh, Ayman Mansour Khalaf, How does the Fintech services delivery affect customer satisfaction: A scenario of Jordanian banking sector, Strategic Change, 30, 4, pp. 405-413, (2021); Allen, David Edmund Edmund, A nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (Nardl) analysis of the ftse and s&p500 indexes, Risks, 9, 11, (2021); International Journal of Scientific and Management Research, (2022); Baur, Aaron Wolfgang, Cryptocurrencies as a disruption? empirical findings on user adoption and future potential of Bitcoin and Co, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9373, pp. 63-80, (2015); Baur, Dirk G., Bitcoin: Medium of exchange or speculative assets?, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 54, pp. 177-189, (2018); Bouri, Elie I., On the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?, Finance Research Letters, 20, pp. 192-198, (2017); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1975); Bruns, Stephan B., Lag length selection and p-hacking in Granger causality testing: prevalence and performance of meta-regression models, Empirical Economics, 56, 3, pp. 797-830, (2019); Guidelines for Financial Institutions Adopting Enabling Technologies, (2021); Chang, Victor I., How Blockchain can impact financial services – The overview, challenges and recommendations from expert interviewees, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 158, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17468817; 17468809","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174250986"

This study aims to understand the challenges of adopting blockchain technology in the financial sector, organise them into a model and classify them for systematic address. Design/methodology/approach: Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) has been carried out along with MICMAC (Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment) analysis to hierarchically structure blockchain adoption problems and categorise the challenges into four classes-autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent for better addressing. The study also uses content analysis using NVivo software. Findings: The digraph depicts the hierarchical challenge model. Vulnerability to financial crimes and glitches, privacy issues and geopolitical tensions due to cross-border transactions are the dependent variables. Complex architecture to comprehend, code and fix, the need for new financial intermediaries, complexity in auditing and the lack of unified governance and coordination among institutions and regulators are the independent variables. The digraph, which is also justified by the qualitative content analysis, is beneficial for stakeholders to systematically address the interdependent challenges associated with blockchain implementations in finance to foster its favourable adoption. Practical implications: The challenges in the adoption of blockchain should be resolved to allow the implementation of this technology in various finance domains. This study enables organisations to carry out resource planning and systematically address these challenges to leverage the advantages of blockchain. Social implications: The results of the present study can help in promoting the proliferation of blockchain for faster, cost-effective, transparent and secure financial transactions and foster innovative and new business models for economic growth.

Servitisation, via value-added services like improved traceability and transparency, can bolster consumer trust and guarantee compliance with halal certification standards. Nonetheless, obstacles such as regulatory intricacies, technological impediments, and cultural factors must be resolved for effective adoption. This study employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) framework to assess 50 peer-reviewed articles obtained from Scopus and Web of Science from year 2014–2024. Four main themes emerge through thematic analysis, (1) halal Compliance and Certification, stressing the necessity for rigorous verification procedures (2) Value Co-Creation, illustrating how servitisation promotes collaboration among stakeholders (3) Technology and Innovation, specifically the impact of blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT)on improving traceability and (4) Sustainability and Ethical Considerations, emphasising the congruence of servitisation with Halal principles of ethical consumption with 12 sub-themes. The results indicate that servitisation improves supply chain efficiency, facilitates regulatory compliance, and fosters innovation within the halal market. Nonetheless, deficiencies in empirical research remain, especially concerning the scalability of digital solutions and the formulation of sustainable servitisation models. The report advocates for additional research on technology-based certification methods, stakeholder engagement tactics, and cross-cultural servitisation frameworks to enhance halal supply chains. This analysis offers practical recommendations for policymakers, industry professionals, and researchers, promoting servitisation as a strategic instrument to enhance halal supply chain resilience, customer trust, and market competitiveness. Future research should investigate the practical applications of digital technology and evaluate their long-term sustainability effects across various halal marketplaces. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Halal Supply Chain; PRISMA; Product Service System; Servitisation","","","","","Abdul Ghani Azmi, Ida Madieha Abd, Guest editorial, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 13, 1, pp. 1-4, (2022); Ahmad, Anis Najiha, Overview of the halal food control system in Malaysia, Food Control, 90, pp. 352-363, (2018); Alamsyah, Andry, Blockchain-Based Traceability System to Support the Indonesian Halal Supply Chain Ecosystem, Economies, 10, 6, (2022); Helmi Ali, Mohd Helmi, Eleven shades of food integrity: A halal supply chain perspective, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 71, pp. 216-224, (2018); Helmi Ali, Mohd Helmi, Food supply chain integrity: The need to go beyond certification, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 117, 8, pp. 1589-1611, (2017); Andersen, Jens Peter, Field-level differences in paper and author characteristics across all fields of science in Web of Science, 2000–2020, Quantitative Science Studies, 4, 2, pp. 394-422, (2023); Anggraini, Wresni, LEAN KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THE ADOPTION OF TRACEABILITY TECHNOLOGY FOR HALAL PERISHABLE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW, Journal of Applied Engineering and Technological Science, 5, 2, pp. 1199-1220, (2024); Bortoluzzi, Guido, Servitisation and performance in the business-to-business context: the moderating role of Industry 4.0 technologies, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 33, 9, pp. 108-128, (2022); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Bux, Christian, Halal Food Sustainability between Certification and Blockchain: A Review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 4, (2022)","","IPMEDIA SDN BHD","","","","","","02184540","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010934128"

Thus, it is important to investigate the factors underlying SMEs’ decision to adopt Fintech. Background Problem: Previous studies have applied various theoretical frameworks to explore Fintech adoption. Despite this, limited knowledge exists regarding the determinants influencing the adoption of Fintech among SMEs. Novelty: By using innovation diffusion theory, this study examines the underlying elements that contribute to the adoption of Fintech by SMEs. Research Methods: Data were collected using the survey approach. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to SMEs in Indonesia using purposive sampling, yielding 273 responses. The data were then analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. Findings/Results: The results confirmed all hypotheses developed for the study. Specifically, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability positively affect attitude towards Fintech adoption. In turn, positive attitude towards the adoption of Fintech has a significant impact on the intention to use Fintech. In addition, attitude mediates the relationship between IDT factors (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability) and Fintech adoption intention. Conclusion: Innovation diffusion theory is able to explain the factors that form SMEs' attitude and adoption intention toward Fintech. The outcomes of this research provide important implications both theoretically and practically. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption intention; Financial technology; innovation diffusion theory","","","","","Abbasi, Kaleemullah, FinTech, SME efficiency and national culture: Evidence from OECD countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2021); Abdul-Rahim, Ruzita, Benefit–Risk Perceptions of FinTech Adoption for Sustainability from Bank Consumers’ Perspective: The Moderating Role of Fear of COVID-19, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022); Acikgoz, Fulya, Curiosity on Cutting-Edge Technology via Theory of Planned Behavior and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 3, 1, (2023); Alhammadi, Khadija, Assessing the effect of innovation diffusion and technology readiness theories on attitude, behavioral intention and implementation of smart learning, Cross Cultural and Strategic Management, 30, 4, pp. 657-675, (2023); Ali, Muhammad, Consumer acceptance toward takaful in Pakistan: An application of diffusion of innovation theory, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 14, 4, pp. 620-638, (2019); Alkhawaldeh, Bashar Younis, The effect of financial technology on financial performance in Jordanian SMEs: The role of financial satisfaction, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 11, 3, pp. 1019-1030, (2023); Arli, Denni I., Exploring the role of innovation attributes on mobile payment adoption, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 40, 7, pp. 826-841, (2023); Chibuogwu, Ashinze Paul, A multidimensional model of sustainable renewable energy linking purchase intentions, attitude and user behavior in nigeria, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 19, (2021); Badi, Sulafa M., Technological, organisational and environmental determinants of smart contracts adoption: UK construction sector viewpoint, Construction Management and Economics, 39, 1, pp. 36-54, (2021); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019)","","Gadjah Mada University","","","","","","23385847; 20858272","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007538802"

However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a meta-analytic comparison of these technologies' effectiveness within the sector. The study aims to bridge the gap by conducting a meta-analysis, assessing the impact of AI and blockchain on various aspects of financial risk management. The study includes a meta-analysis approach, systematically synthesizing findings from recent studies on blockchain and AI in financial risk management. Following strict inclusion criteria, a comprehensive search through Scopus and Google Scholar led to the selection of 36 studies for analysis. The forest plots and summary tables were generated using Meta-Essentials, a statistical tool for meta-analyses that calculates effect sizes, confidence intervals, and pooled esti-mates using fixed and random effects models for accurate interpretation. The meta-analysis revealed that blockchain technology enhances financial security and transpar-ency, particularly post-COVID, addressing operational risks with a modest but non-sig-nificant effect (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99-1.10, p = 0.11). AI demonstrated a neutral impact on risk management (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.04, p = 0.71) but excelled in fraud detection and predictive analytics. Funnel plot analysis showed minimal publication bias, and forest plots confirmed consistent findings across studies. These results showed that Blockchain enhances transparency and security post-COVID, mitigating financial digital threats, while AI excels in fraud detection and predictive analytics. AI revolutionizes risk management through predictive insights, while blockchain ensures data integrity.

The primary objective is to evaluate how AI can be integrated to enhance risk assessment effectiveness while ensuring compliance with Islamic legal principles (Fiqh), particularly the prohibition of Riba, the avoidance of Gharar, and the promotion of ethical transparency. A qualitative methodology with a descriptive analytical approach is employed in this research. Data sources include scholarly literature, regulatory policies, industry reports, and case studies related to AI adoption in Islamic finance. The analysis utilizes the IFAS and EFAS to assess internal and external factors influencing AI adoption. Additionally, an Islamic legal analysis is conducted to ensure that AI implementation aligns with Shariah principles. The findings reveal that AI has significant potential to enhance efficiency and innovation in Islamic finance. However, challenges such as infrastructure limitations and a lack of technological literacy pose obstacles to its implementation. From an external perspective, opportunities for financial inclusion and strategic technological partnerships are expanding, yet concerns regarding data security and regulatory uncertainties remain prevalent. From an Islamic legal standpoint, this study underscores the importance of developing an AI framework that adheres to Shariah principles. The adoption of AI in Islamic finance must follow a balanced approach by leveraging external opportunities, addressing internal challenges, and ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards.

Volatility and gharar are mutually reinforcing phenomena, while speculative behaviors such as margin trading and short selling intensify both factors, resulting in price distortions, obscured asset valuations, and reduced investor trust in Sharia-compliant instruments. Purpose/Study Objectives: The objective of this research is to examine the characteristics and legal dimensions of both volatility and gharar in Islamic capital markets, assess their collective impact on Sharia-compliant issuers, and propose integrated governance, legal, business, and technological strategies to mitigate associated risks and enhance market resilience. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study adopted a juridical-empirical-normative approach. The empirical aspect involved collecting and analyzing market data from the Indonesian Islamic capital market. At the same time, the normative analysis focused on evaluating regulatory instruments, including DSN-MUI Fatwa No. 80/2011 and OJK Regulation No. 15/POJK.04/2015, and within the context of Sharia principles and business law. Findings: The study finds that both gharar and market volatility contribute to structural weaknesses in Islamic capital markets. In addition, speculative trading practices amplify uncertainty and instability, demanding a regulatory response that limits such activities. Strengthening corporate governance, enhancing disclosure practices, and applying business law mechanisms are essential to risk mitigation.

After data reduction, presentation, description and validation, this paper develops the theory and presents it as a qualitative thematic analysis. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that those who had socialised Sharia pawnshops had a low literacy level. Nonetheless, the socialisation of Sharia pawnshops increases literacy and public understanding of pawnshop products in Sharia pawnshops. This issue arises because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes it impossible for Sharia pawnshops to hold an event or socialise.

These advancements empower users to bypass traditional intermediaries, achieving cost reductions and fostering safer, more efficient information and verification processes. However, the rapid evolution of fintech demands a deeper understanding of how accountability can be integrated into this transformative ecosystem. This research employs bibliometric analysis to synthesize existing knowledge on fintech and accountability-enabling technologies, exploring associated risks and opportunities. The study focuses on critical dimensions such as sustainability, governance, and innovative accounting approaches, illustrating how these technologies foster transparency and trust in financial systems. It also examines the interplay between fintech, ethical finance, and predictive technologies, emphasizing their role in forecasting financial, environmental, and social impacts. The findings highlight the importance of aligning disruptive technologies with global sustainability goals, including the Paris Climate Agreement and the SDGs, while addressing regulatory challenges. This research contributes by advancing theoretical insights into fintech's accountability and providing practical recommendations for decision-makers and policymakers.

A qualitative research method is adopted in this study to address the concept of e-wallet, Sharīʿah contracts, issues, and challenges from the Sharīʿah perspective. The collected data of this study is analyzed through an explanatory research approach to fulfill the objectives of this study. The study finds that the Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet is realizable from the Sharīʿah perspective. Although a wadīʿah contract is used for deposit/safekeeping purposes, in this study the concept of qarḍ seems to be a better choice for a contract between user and issuer. However, the cashback and rewards are some issues that arise while using the qarḍ contract since a borrower (issuer) is not allowed to return additional benefits/amount to the lender. In this regard, the study concludes that the benefits of e-wallets either might come from the merchant or the issuer. If those benefits are given by the issuer out of his generosity, and without any condition from the borrower (user), the offer of such benefits will be permissible, on the other hand, if it comes in return for a condition, that will be impermissible. Moreover, the benefits provided by the merchants seem to be permissible due to sale contracts in that transaction. The study also finds that a Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet is required to transfer the funds to a trust account under an Islamic financial institution so that it does not issue an interest for that fund. Additionally, if the fund is allowed to invest, it should be invested in a Sharīʿah compliant investment. The results of this study assist the e-wallet providers to consider Sharīʿah compliance of the e-wallet. In particular, the findings reveal the possibilities of Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet regardless of the issues and challenges it might face. Moreover, it provides room for users who are Islamic fintech enthusiasts. This research presents a deeper insight into wadīʿah and qarḍ contract to be used as underlying contracts between e-wallet providers and users. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cashback; E-Wallet; qarḍ; rewards; Sharīʿah compliant e-wallet","","","","","Bitara International Journal of Civilizational Studies and Human Sciences, (2022); Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Public Policy and Social Science Icops 2021, (2021); International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration, (2025); Aji, Hendy Mustiko, How e-wallets encourage excessive spending behavior among young adult consumers?, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 16, 6, pp. 868-884, (2022); Aji, Hendy Mustiko, The effects of subjective norm and knowledge about riba on intention to use e-money in Indonesia, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 12, 6, pp. 1180-1196, (2021); Alam, Md Mahmudul, Using e-wallet for business process development: challenges and prospects in Malaysia, Business Process Management Journal, 27, 4, pp. 1142-1162, (2021); Asna Al Matalib Fi Sharh Rawd Al Talib; Kashf Al Qina an Matn Al Iqna, (2025); Sharh Munthaa Al Iradat, (2000); A Al Bukhr","","Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","","","","","","25904396; 19857454","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008354281"

The study is driven by the need for Sharia-compliant institutions to enhance efficiency and ensure adherence to Sharia principles in fiduciary oversight. AI has the potential to expedite analysis and accurately detect fiduciary breaches. The research examines internal and external factors influencing AI adoption while identifying potential benefits and challenges. From an internal perspective, strengths such as operational efficiency and compliance with Sharia principles are predominant, with a total IFAS score of 1.17, indicating that strengths outweigh weaknesses in AI implementation. Externally, factors like government regulatory support for digitalization and the growth of Sharia fintech offer significant opportunities, reflected in an EFAS score of 1.23. However, there are threats to consider, including rapid regulatory changes and potential security risks. Overall, the application of AI in fiduciary supervision, in line with Islamic law principles, can positively impact both conventional and Islamic financial sectors. With an effective implementation strategy, internal and external challenges can be managed, allowing for the optimization of AI technology that aligns with principles of justice and transparency in Islamic law, thereby enhancing accountability and public trust in Sharia-compliant institutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Fiduciary; Islamic Legal Principles","","","","","Agung, I.

The data were collected during the years 2022/23 from 370 experts in finance, accounting, and auditing of businesses in Kosovo, while their processing was done through exploratory factorial analysis (EFA), confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA), and modeling of structural equations (SEM) using SPSS and AMOS programs. The results indicate that there are symbiotic relationships through direct and indirect effects on the factors, therefore digitalization has a positive effect on finance, accounting, and reporting. Specifically, the digitalization of expenses and cost planning (DECP) has a direct effect on the digitalization of transactions, financial reporting, and monitoring (DTFRM). This effect contributes to improvement, transparency, and decision making (DITDM). However, the DTFRM factor does not have a direct effect on the DITDM factor but has a mediated effect on the effect of DECP on DITDM. This means that in order to enhance improvement, transparency, and decision making (DITDM), the digitalization of expenses and cost planning (DECP) should also include financial transactions, financial reporting, and control processes (DTFRM). Therefore, the study highlights that digitalization plays a significant role in improving financial, accounting, and auditing processes as a strategic move to enhance their financial management capabilities, transparency, decision making, and control. For future studies, it is emphasized to conduct in depth research and analysis to better understand the complex relationship between DTFRM and DITDM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Digitalization; Finance; Reporting; Symbiotic Relationships","","","","","Afuah, Allan N., Redefining firm boundaries in the face of the internet: Are firms really shrinking?, Academy of Management Review, 28, 1, pp. 34-53, (2003); Agyenim-Boateng, Cletus, The role of structure in manipulating PPP accountability, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 1, pp. 119-144, (2017); Allain, Élodie, Explaining implementation difficulties associated with activity-based costing through system uses, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 19, 1, pp. 181-198, (2018); Amonoo Nkrumah, Beatrice, Stakeholder accountability in the era of big data: an exploratory study of online platform companies, Qualitative Research in Accounting and Management, 20, 4, pp. 447-484, (2023); Azam, Md Shah, Diffusion of ICT and SME performance, Advances in Business Marketing and Purchasing, 23A, pp. 7-290, (2015); Bai, Chunguang, COVID-19 pandemic digitization lessons for sustainable development of micro-and small- enterprises, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 1989-2001, (2021); Ben Bouheni, Faten, An econometric understanding of Fintech and operating performance, Review of Accounting and Finance, 22, 3, pp. 329-352, (2023); Bi, Gongbing, The impact of information transparency on trade credit: the mediation role of risk, Kybernetes, 53, 1, pp. 27-57, (2024); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2016); Bilal, Bilal, Do the educational profile, gender, and professional experience of audit committee financial experts improve financial reporting quality?, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 53, (2023)","","Sciendo","","","","","","18424120; 23445416","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005635057"

In this context, fintechs represent a vector of exponential change in the global financial system and its institutions. However, despite the existing relationship between fintechs and institutions, there is a need for more studies exploring the connections between them. Beginning with a framework that integrates aspects of the relation between fintechs and institutions in the financial system, the objective of this article is to empirically demonstrate the interaction between fintechs and financial system institutions in an emerging country. To do so, the chosen research method was an embedded case study, which involved documental analysis and semi-structured interviews conducted with different agents in the Brazilian financial system, belonging to the following categories: technology providers, fintechs, regulatory institutions, financial institutions, and consumers. The findings validate the applicability of the theoretical framework, highlighting that fintechs drive institutional changes across stakeholders with different characteristic traits. Based on these results, we created theoretical propositions that guide future studies on the topic of fintechs and institutions. This study’s contributions provide valuable insights for financial policymakers, regulators, and technology providers, particularly regarding the adaptation of regulatory frameworks and technological infrastructures in emerging economies.

This product operates on a profit-sharing principle, distinguishing it from conventional deposits relying on interest-based systems. The profit-sharing mechanism helps Islamic banks avoid the adverse spread risk faced by conventional banks and changes the legal relationship between depositors and banks. This study addresses the shift in the legal relationship from a creditor-debtor model, as seen in conventional banks, to a partnership-based model in Islamic banking, emphasising equal profit sharing. The research examines the legal construction of this partnership, where the depositor entrusts funds to the bank, which manages them following Sharia principles. Using a normative legal method, the study draws on data from legal documents and regulations to analyse the protections provided to depositors, focusing on compliance with Islamic law and the bank's fiduciary responsibility. The result highlights that depositors in Mudharabah schemes receive enhanced legal protection, benefiting from better governance, risk management, and adherence to Sharia principles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic Banking; Legal Protection; Legal Relationship; Mudharabah Deposit; Profit-Sharing","","","","","Petita Jurnal Kajian Ilmu Hukum Dan Syariah, (2020); Ahmad, Muneer, Consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking: decision-making analysis through AHP, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 15, 5, pp. 1280-1302, (2024); Al Hikmah International Journal of Islamic Studies and Human Sciences, (2023); Akbar, M.

As time goes by, classical waqf, which generally focuses on immovable objects such as land and buildings, faces challenges in adapting to developments in information technology and modern financial systems. Traditional endowment management systems often lack transparency, which can reduce public trust. Digital waqf emerged as an alternative to answer the need for flexibility and efficiency in managing endowment assets. However, based on previous research, digital waqf, considered an alternative solution, tends to experience a shift in concept, where most implementations focus more on collecting funds than basic Islamic social principles, such as transparency and sustainable management. of research findings obtained using the literature review method: namely, Firstly, digital waqf significantly differs significantly different from classical waqf in terms of mechanisms, instruments, and management This innovation simplifies the endowment process through technology but it raises new challenges related to Sharia supervision and understanding contracts. Second, digital Waqf can distort concepts, such as adjusting contracts that are not by sharia and in practice, such as a lack of management transparency. However, this potential distortion can be minimized with appropriate regulations and technology implementation. Third, digital waqf can be adapted to Sharia principles if it meets the requirements for a valid contract, management transparency, and sustainability of endowment assets. Technologies such as blockchain and Sharia auditing play an important role in ensuring this compliance. With a careful approach and cross-sector collaboration, digital waqf can become an important instrument for empowering communities and supporting sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classic Waqf; Digital Waqf; Distortion; Innovation; Sharia Principles","","","","","Roziq, Ahmad, An Escalation Model of Muzakki’s Trust and Loyalty towards Payment of Zakat at BAZNAS Indonesia, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 3, pp. 551-559, (2021); Sawmar, Abdulsalam Ahmed, How Governance Practices Influence Mandatory Zakah Payment in Saudi Arabia?, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 34, 1, pp. 3-24, (2021); Lan Tabur Jurnal Ekonomi Syariah, (2021); Peran Teknologi Dalam Optimalisasi Pengumpulan Dan Distribusi Zakat Dan Wakaf, (2024); Journal of Islamic Economics, (2015); Al Infaq Jurnal Ekonomi Islam, (2022); Ultra Petita and the Threat to Constitutional Justice the Indonesian Experience, (2018); Armia, Muhammad Siddiq, Public caning: Should it be maintained or eliminated?

To facilitate the development of products and enhance public interest, it is important for Islamic banking institutions to comprehend the elements that may impact the intents of Muslim communities in Indonesia when selecting Islamic home financing products with Murabaha contracts. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the many aspects that may have an impact on the decision-making process of Muslim communities in Indonesia when selecting Islamic home financing product that use Murabaha contracts. Design/methodology/approach: The partial least square-structural equation modeling data processing techniques will be used to process and evaluate these components. The data used in this study was acquired by administering questionnaires to a sample of 298 Muslim communities, which were randomly selected from a pool of 301 possible customers of Islamic house finance in Indonesia. Findings: The results of this research show that attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have positive influence on intention to choose an Islamic home financing scheme with Murabaha agreement, while price fairness of Islamic home financing and Islamic altruism have direct and indirect influence on intention to choose Islamic home financing. Research limitations/implications: Analyzing factors that affect intention to choose Islamic home financing product under Murabaha contract is essential. Future study is required to analyze other Islamic home financing products, such as istisna, ijarah muntahia bi tamlik and diminishing musharakah. This study only serves as a foundation for further investigations into conventional approaches to home financing in emerging nations. The areas can be expanded to be implemented in other countries. Practical implications: It is anticipated that Islamic banks have the capacity to cultivate a favorable and constructive perception, hence fostering a positive disposition among the Muslim populace in Indonesia. Furthermore, it is essential for Islamic banks to guarantee that all stakeholders within the sharia-compliant institution, particularly the frontline staff, have enough expertise and understanding of the intricacies of Islamic home financing products including Murabaha contracts, which are intended for prospective customers. In the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that the Muslim population in Indonesia would exhibit a greater intention toward the use of Islamic home financing solutions that use Murabaha contracts, facilitated by the establishment of a conducive environment.

However, a notable gap exists between the potential and adoption of the two emerging technologies, further exacerbated by the nascent state of research in this domain. This research aims to establish the best practices that innovatively strengthen the identified enablers to decisively tackle challenges, ensuring the efficient implementation of IoT-DT for ROC emissions in buildings. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a mixed-method approach. Questionnaire data from 220 multidiscipline professionals were analysed via structural equation modelling analysis, while interview data obtained from 18 stakeholders were analysed using thematic content analysis. The findings were triangulated for cohesive interpretation. Findings: After the analysis of questionnaire data, a structural model was established, depicting the critical challenges (inadequate data security, limited technical expertise and scalability issues) and key enablers (robust data security measures, skill development and government incentives) of implementing IoT-DT for ROC. Sequentially, analysis of in-depth interview data revealed the IoT-based DT best practices (safeguarding data, upskilling and incentivization). Upon triangulating the questionnaire and interview findings, this study explicitly highlights the potential of the established best practices to strategically strengthen enablers, thereby mitigating challenges and ensuring the successful implementation of IoT-based DT for ROC emissions in buildings.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzed scholarly studies to investigate existing literature and current as well as future trends in the adoption of the metaverse in HL, supply chains and consumer behavior. The study explores the thematic structure of the current knowledge landscape, identifies research gaps and highlights potential directions for future research at the intersection of the metaverse, supply chain and halal behavior. The authors identified 286 papers that examined the integration of the metaverse with HL practices, supply chain management strategies and consumer behavior in alignment with Islamic principles and standards. Findings: The results indicate a limited number of studies on the successful adoption of the metaverse in HL, HSCM and behavioral research. This paper has proposed a framework for the metaverse-supply chain and halal behavior. The framework can serve as a reference for scholars and practitioners on how to incorporate advanced technology to engage with and predict market demand. Additionally, the metaverse-supply chain framework can be used to align with halal supply chain practices based on customer needs and preferences. The metaverse integrates the virtual world, enabling halal supply chain networks to enhance virtual reality, digital experiences and business performance. Practical implications: The halal industry can showcase products and services through virtual scenarios, avatars and shops. By developing a halal-compliant metaverse, the halal industry can facilitate activities such as online sales, online payments and virtual marketing, thereby enabling a digital business transformation. Embracing the metaverse can improve business efficiency and influence consumer behavior, decisions and compliance with Shariah principles. Originality/value: The authors argue that this paper is at the forefront and will serve as a reference for future research.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a quantitative approach to combine the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DIT) to comprehensively analyze the elements that affect the adoption of digital technology. SmartPLS software conducted the data analysis after collecting the data using SPSS. In this study, 310 respondents comprising Muslims who contribute to waqf were collected. Findings: This research provides important insights into the elements influencing future behavior and can help policymakers promote and facilitate the digitalisation of waqf activities, not only in Malaysia but also in similar situations worldwide. Research limitations/implications: Analysis indicated that four hypotheses were validated, implying that effort expectancy, compatibility, observability and trialability are significant determinants affecting intention. The findings suggest significant potential for further research. This paper delineates numerous methodological challenges and concerns while proposing recommendations for further research. Future research could use additional search phrases and engines not incorporated in this study to provide a more comprehensive overview. This study primarily concentrates on the applications of waqf development, digitalisation, blockchain, crowdfunding and artificial intelligence. Practical implications: The four hypotheses regarding facilitating condition, performance expectation, relative advantage and social influence were not supported as they were found to have no significant impact on intention. For practitioners, based on the findings, it can give some insight into digitalisation’s influence on the intention of contributing to waqf in society. As for the researchers, there could be some ideas to study other than the factors mentioned in this study, as well as the supporting literature for their studies. Originality/value: This paper provides useful insights on how emerging technology can potentially disrupt the traditional waqf landscape.

SMEs are increasingly implementing sustainable business models to tackle resource constraints and environmental issues to foster long-term social and environmental impact. A quantitative research design was employed, with data collected through questionnaires distributed to SME owners using purposive sampling. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed, with 106 valid responses analyzed. The study employed descriptive statistics and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS 4.0 to assess the framework. The findings reveal significant positive effects of financial institutions, globalization impact, and access to finance on the role of waqf in SME development, while business obstacles and government support showed no significant influence. According to this study, open innovation is crucial to fostering collaboration between small- and medium-sized enterprises, Islamic endowments, and external stakeholders such as non-profits, government agencies, and community groups.

Furthermore, global price fluctuations—often beyond the control of local governments—exacerbate domestic price volatility. The rice supply chain in East Java exhibits a complex structure, heavily dependent on intermediaries (middlemen) who dominate distribution channels and suppress grain prices. This dominance by intermediaries leads to profit disparities and diminishes farmers' incentives to increase production and improve harvest quality. Using a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD), this research identifies a reinforcing feedback loop that perpetuates import dependency and a balancing loop facilitated by BULOG's strategic role in price stabilization and stock management. Dynamic simulations under three import policy scenarios (Import Policy Factors of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8) reveal the significant effects of these policies on BULOG's stock levels, domestic production, import volumes, agricultural land-use and domestic rice prices. The Import Policy Factor 0.2 scenario supports domestic production, achieving output levels of up to 5,512,795 tons while minimizing dependence on imports, stabilizing domestic rice prices at IDR 13,004 per kilograms and improving farmers' welfare. Conversely, the 0.8 scenario highlights heavy import dependence, with domestic production plummeting to 2,441,428 tons, exposing the sector to global price volatility and undermining the competitiveness of local farmers. The findings underscore the critical need for agricultural land-use diversification into high-value crops, the establishment of equitable regulatory frameworks, and incentives to sustain farmers' productivity. An optimized communication model is proposed to foster collaboration among key supply chain stakeholders—government agencies, BULOG, farmers, intermediaries, and distributors—through accessible digital tools such as dashboards and mobile applications. This approach improves policy transparency, strengthens distribution networks, and promotes price stability, contributing to a more sustainable regional food system. This research provides a strategic framework for integrating import policy, domestic production strategies, and commodity diversification to bolster food security in East Java. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic systems; Food security; Import policy; Rice supply chain; Supply chain communication","","","","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests.

Digitalisation in the Islamic finance sector plays a strategic role in expanding access to financial inclusion and facilitating more effective community involvement in sharia-based economic activities. Using the robust least squares (RLS) method, this study utilises secondary data for the period 2018-2023 to evaluate the impact of Islamic crowdfunding and e-wakaf on the growth of Islamic fintech. The results show that Islamic crowdfunding significantly expands access to alternative funding, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), while e-wakaf improves transparency and efficiency of waqf asset management through digital technology.

The growth of Fintech is driven by advanced technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI, and robo-advisors, while also posing challenges for regulators and market participants. Fintech research is essential for driving innovation, shaping the future of finance, and addressing emerging challenges. This study examines the awareness and knowledge of Fintech concepts among female university students in Somalia. Using a quantitative cross-sectional research design, 92 students from four universities were surveyed to assess their familiarity with key Fintech topics, including blockchain, smart contracts, neo-banking, and cloud computing. The findings reveal significant gaps in Fintech literacy, with a majority of students showing limited awareness of emerging technologies. While 63% of students expressed the need for a dedicated Fintech course, only 32.6% felt adequately prepared for the Fintech industry. Regression analysis indicated that a student’s major significantly influences their Fintech knowledge.

Using a quantitative approach, the study surveyed 350 stakeholders in Saudi Arabia’s Islamic finance sector, including corporate managers, investment professionals, and financial analysts, over a six-month period (May to October 2024). The findings indicate that stakeholders perceive a positive relationship between ESG disclosures and financial performance, particularly when companies align their ESG practices with Islamic finance principles. However, the study does not measure actual financial performance; rather, it assesses stakeholders’ perceptions of ESG’s influence on corporate governance, risk management, and investment attractiveness. Results suggest that companies integrating ESG principles with Maqasid al-Shariah foster greater stakeholder trust, enhance corporate responsibility, and promote long-term sustainability. However, variations in trust and investment decisions exist based on industry type, ESG disclosure levels, and demographic factors such as experience and familiarity with ESG practices. The study provides novel insights into how Islamic finance principles shape ESG disclosure practices, offering practical recommendations for improving corporate governance and sustainability. By emphasizing transparency, ethical investment, and regulatory alignment, these findings contribute to ongoing discussions on sustainable finance and the role of ESG in shaping Islamic financial institutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ESG disclosure; financial performance; Islamic finance; Saudi Stock Exchange; Shariah compliance; sustainability","financial market; financial services; Islamism; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; stock market; sustainability; Saudi Arabia","","","","Gutiérrez-Ponce, Herenia, Do Sustainability Activities Affect the Financial Performance of Banks?

We review the literature on crypto-asset estate planning and explore lessons from Islamic finance regarding crypto assets. We then use quantitative analysis to compare price-volume relationships in Islamicoin and Bitcoin. To strengthen our analysis, we employ the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate, parametric survival analysis, and the Probit model. Our findings show that Islamicoin's trade volume predicts market price changes more often than Bitcoin's, which seems to be influenced by factors other than trade volume. Further investigation reveals that securities regulators are increasingly enforcing rules against crypto-trading violations. These violations typically occur when trading activity decreases while prices increase. We also find that widespread price changes tend to motivate people to violate the regulations over time. Recently, positive price changes, rather than trade volume, have been the main factor influencing regulatory violations. However, trade effects were observed later in some of our models. Given these findings, we conclude that regulators need to improve digital assets Act to address estate planning issues, in addition to protecting investors.

Through regression analysis, we identify several factors—such as article length, age, position in the issue (lead article status), regional author affiliation, title characteristics (length and novelty), and the presence of multiple authors, keywords, figures, and tables—as significant determinants of citation rates. Furthermore, STM reveals ten dominant themes in BIR, highlighting key focus areas, such as firm dynamics, market and country growth, financial health, and stock market returns.

The novelty of this research lies in its systematic exploration of key issues such as the speculative nature, intrinsic value, and potential for financial harm (gharar) associated with cryptocurrencies. This study adopts a qualitative approach, drawing upon primary sources of Islamic jurisprudence namely the Quran, Hadith, and classical scholarly interpretations while also incorporating contemporary fatwas, insights from prominent Islamic finance scholars, and expert interviews to inform the analysis. The results highlight divergent viewpoints on the permissibility of cryptocurrency investments, with some scholars asserting their compliance under specific conditions, while others deem them non-compliant due to risks of speculation and uncertainty. The study concludes by proposing a set of actionable guidelines for Muslim investors, underscoring the significance of grasping the intricacies of Shariah principles in cryptocurrency investments and highlighting the necessity for continuous scholarly engagement in this evolving domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crypto currencies; Financial inclusion; Islamic law; Shariah compatibility","","","","","Abedifar, Pejman, Formalism versus Purposivism in Islamic Jurisprudence: The Case of Islamic Finance Law, Religions, 14, 4, (2023); International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Growth Evaluation, (2025); Aftab, Muhammad, The COVID-19 pandemic, economic policy uncertainty and the hedging role of cryptocurrencies: a global perspective, China Finance Review International, 13, 3, pp. 471-508, (2023); Ahmed, Walid M.A., How do Islamic equity markets respond to good and bad volatility of cryptocurrencies?

The findings showed that Conventional Banking Credit Growth, Sharia Banking Financing Growth, PMTB, LDR and FDR, and ROA of conventional and Sharia banks had a positive effect on economic growth in Indonesia. The inflation variables, NPF, and NPL had a negative effect on economic growth in Indonesia. This finding provided us with an understanding that the existence of Sharia banking could drive economic growth in Indonesia. In conventional banks, in the long term, there was a long-term relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables.

Design/methodology/approach: The review of literature and structural equation modelling approach using judgemental sampling on extended TAM and determinants of e-wallet apps’ acceptance related to asnaf (donee) were conducted in a bid to contribute to the factors that are instrumental in determining acceptance of e-wallet services among asnaf. Findings: The findings indicate that the e-wallet app’s service acceptance is determined not only by perceived usefulness, consumer maqasid index and consumer innovativeness but also by subjective norms. On the contrary, consumer maqasid index and perceived ease of use do not lend themselves to be the factor of asnafs’ e-wallet acceptance. The authors extend the TAM model to determine the factors that may be influential in predicting the e-wallet app acceptance by asnaf. Research limitations/implications: In assessing future outcomes when different sampling techniques are opted for and geographic coverage is expanded, this study should be considered in terms of the limited scope. Practical implications: This study is intended to serve as a reference for making a significant contribution related to user acceptance factors related to alms tax-based e-wallet apps in asnafs’ context in Malaysia in terms of both theory and practice. Originality/value: TAM is extended in the context of e-wallet app acceptance among asnafs’. A variable, namely, consumer innovativeness, is tested using the extended TAM model. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, consumer innovativeness in the context of asnafs’ acceptance of e-wallet apps is yet to be tested.

The primary purpose is to explore blockchain’s potential to address financial risks and inefficiencies while ensuring compliance with Islamic values. Islamic financial institutions face challenges maintaining transaction security and transparency under Sharia constraints, especially as risks like fraud, manipulation, and operational inefficiencies persist. Blockchain’s decentralised ledger system offers solutions by ensuring immutable transaction records, real-time transparency, and secure cryptographic frameworks. Smart contracts further automate Sharia-compliant processes, reducing risks of non-compliance and fraud, while operational efficiencies are achieved through reduced costs and faster transaction processing. However, implementing blockchain in Sharia financial institutions faces limitations, including a lack of technical expertise, regulatory clarity, and inadequate infrastructure in many regions. These barriers highlight the need for capacity-building initiatives and robust regulations to support blockchain adoption in Islamic finance. The study emphasises blockchain’s transformative potential to revolutionise Islamic finance, fostering trust and operational excellence while overcoming current barriers through collaborative efforts.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework and fractional equity model (FEM) are developed to incorporate big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology in an ecosystem for affordability and sustainability of homeownership via the proposed financing model. In addition, the FEM adopts the simulation approach to show its validity in terms of liquidity when compared with traditional home financing. In this regard, this paper is focused on developing and demonstrating the feasibility of a new financing model, rather than testing specific hypotheses or relationships. This is to propose the democratization model for Islamic Home Financing that will not benefit the prospective home buyers without compromising the profitability of the financial institutions. Findings: The findings indicate that the proposed end-to-end solution within the financing ecosystem can lead to more efficient matching market between the buyers and sellers of houses, reduced transaction costs, greater transparency and enhanced efficiency which in the end could lead to lower costs of owning homes and sustained financial resilience among house owners. The findings indicate that the FEM model is able to increase homeownership with more elements of liquidity, marketability and sustainability for homebuyers. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the potential of big data and blockchain technology in democratizing Islamic home financing and evidence that the transfer of ownership is possible through tokenization. However, this will require a mature financing environment to adapt the technology for practical application. Practical implications: The model proposes a solution to propagate shared prosperity among stakeholders such as the house buyers/owners, sellers, investors as well the government agencies. The proposed FEM model provides alternative home financing that is more marketable, flexible and sustainable for households/buyers and financiers. Social implications: It is hoped that with the proposed financing ecosystem to promote affordability and sustainability of homeownership via big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology can lead to greater financial resilience for homeowners which can then be translated to enhanced well-being, increased productivity and can further promote economic growth.

These concerns arise due to the rapid digital transformation and the evolving landscape of financial technologies. In today's digital era, electronic payment (e-payment) systems play a pivotal role in facilitating transactions across global economies. However, alongside their convenience, e-payment systems present significant challenges related to security, privacy, and ethical considerations, particularly when viewed through the lens of Islamic finance. The objective of this study is to examine how Islamic principles can guide the development and implementation of e-payment systems to protect users effectively. It aims to identify key principles from Islamic finance that can enhance security, ensure fairness, and uphold ethical standards in e-payment transactions. This study adopts a qualitative research method, focusing on documentation and secondary sources, by examining and analyzing users protection in e-payment transactions from an Islamic perspective. Through an analysis of Islamic financial principles such as transparency, fairness, security, and ethical conduct, this paper finds that integrating these principles into e-payment systems can mitigate risks and enhance user confidence. Moreover, avoiding uncertainty (gharar) and gambling (maysir) in e-payment transactions underscores the importance of clear and non-speculative terms. The implications of this study are significant for stakeholders in the e-payment industry, including financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and policymakers. By aligning e-payment practices with Islamic ethical norms, stakeholders can foster trust among Islamic users, enhance regulatory compliance, and promote sustainable economic development. This paper underscores the importance of integrating Islamic ethical principles into e-payment systems to ensure the protection and welfare of Islamic users. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","E-payment transaction; ethical obligation; user protection","","","","","Abdillah, Masykuri, Sharia and Politics in the Context of Globalization and Society 5.0, Ahkam: Jurnal Ilmu Syariah, 22, 2, pp. 263-286, (2022); Ahmad, Azlin Alisa, The Position of Smart Contracts in the Light of Islamic Contract Theory, Samarah, 8, 1, pp. 144-171, (2024); Ahmed, Habib, Financial Consumer Protection Regime in Malaysia: Assessment of the Legal and Regulatory Framework, Journal of Consumer Policy, 41, 2, pp. 159-175, (2018); Ahyani, Hisam, Building the Values of Rahmatan Lil 'Alamin for Indonesian Economic Development at 4.0 Era from the Perspective of Philosophy and Islamic Economic Law, Al-Ihkam: Jurnal Hukum dan Pranata Sosial, 16, 1, pp. 111-136, (2021); Journal of Public Administration and Governance, (2018); International Journal of Emerging Trends in Engineering Research, (2020); American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, (2019); Alziyadat, Naser, Ethical decision-making in Islamic financial institutions in light of Maqasid Al-Sharia: A conceptual framework, Thunderbird International Business Review, 61, 5, pp. 707-718, (2019); Aman, Ameenullah, Islamic marketing ethics for Islamic financial institutions, International Journal of Ethics and Systems, 36, 1, pp. 1-11, (2020); Ambore, Stephen, A resilient cybersecurity framework for Mobile Financial Services (MFS), Journal of Cyber Security Technology, 1, 3-4, pp. 202-224, (2017)","","Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry","","","","","","25493167; 25493132","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016173653"

However, the implementation of the Absolute Assignment in the context of Islamic estate planning is still unclear and will affect to the inheritance conflicts. Therefore, this study will analyze the extent to which the integration of the Absolute Assignment can be implemented in the Islamic estate planning industry, especially involving the appointment of trust institutions as a trustee. This study is qualitative by using the content analysis method on journal articles, books, acts and court cases. Interview were also conducted with representatives of two trust institutions in Malaysia, namely Amanah Raya Berhad (ARB) and as-Salihin Trustee Berhad, to find out about estate planning products that use Absolute Assignment. In addition, an interview was also conducted with a takaful practitioner from Takaful Ikhlas company to learn more about the implementation of the Absolute Assignment. In conclusion, this study found that there are four main implications through the integration of Absolute Assignment in the takaful industry, namely speeding up the estate administration process, helping to ease the cost burden, safeguarding the welfare of beneficiaries and free tax of takaful benefit.

While there are several models of cash waqf operating in different countries, there is increasing demand for innovative cash waqf models, especially within the financial technology context. This paper aims to propose a practical alternative model of funding for waqf institutions using the concepts of crowdfunding and cash waqf. Design/methodology/approach: This study evaluated the literature relevant to cash waqf models that have been implemented in different countries and proposed a new viable alternative model. Findings: Results offer an alternative financing model, named crowdfunding cash waqf model, for waqf institutions to overcome monetary constraints and enable development projects to be completed. Practical implications: The current study has important implications for both officials and relevant stakeholders. It is sought to bring better consistency between cash waqf donors, solving the liquidity problem faced by waqf institutions, enhancing the transparency of waqf institutions and their use of waqf funds, wealth circulation and financing businesses without interest-based loans (riba). By incorporating a crowdfunding and investment mechanism in the model, this method of collecting funds will assist governments in reducing their expenditure on waqf institutions and other social development programmes. Originality/value: The proposed model differs from current methods of generating cash waqf, including those are also internet-based. The proposed model is devised to help waqf institutions achieve financial sustainability by including an investment mechanism in the model to sustain the development of waqf projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash waqf; Cash waqf model (CFCWM); Crowdfunding; Fourth industrial revolution; Shariah; Waqf institution","","","","","Contemporary Waqf Administration and Development in Singapore Challenges and Prospects, (2007); Abdul Shukor, Syadiyah, Trust on awqaf institutions: evidence from Malaysia, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 10, 2, pp. 511-524, (2019); Abdullah, Mohammad Azmi, Waqf and trust: the nature, structures and socio-economic impacts, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 10, 4, pp. 512-527, (2019); Islamic Economic Studies, (2020); Cash Waqf Exploring Concepts Jurisprudential Boundaries and Applicability to Contemporary Islamic Microfinance, (2013); Waqf, (2010); Idaratu Wa Tasmiru Mutamallakatul Awqaf, (1994); Recherches Et Applications En Finance Islamique Rafi, (2022); Waqf Led Islamic Social Finance Innovative Solutions to Modern Applications, (2020); Asni, Fathullah Al Haq Muhamad, Socio-economics and management of Muslim cemetery waqf using istibdal and GIS method in Penang state, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 11, 7, pp. 1343-1362, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17590825; 17590817","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172759460"

Zakāh, a core Islamic practice aimed at reducing socioeconomic inequality, often falls short of its potential due to inefficiencies and a lack of accountability in the current system. By analyzing secondary sources, this study highlights how blockchain and smart contracts can transform Zakāh collection and distribution. The proposed model promises greater transparency, trust among donors, and more efficient fund allocation, which could boost formal contributions and significantly reduce poverty in the Indian Muslim community. A critical insight is the lack of research on blockchain’s role in Zakāh distribution and its societal impact in India. Additionally, outdated data on Zakāh funds underscores the need for modernization. The study synthesizes existing knowledge through a systematic review while addressing ethical concerns and methodological limitations. Adopting a qualitative approach, it provides a fresh perspective on blockchain’s potential to enhance Zakāh systems and offers a practical framework for policymakers and religious leaders to implement meaningful changes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain technology; Efficient distribution; Indian Muslim community; poverty; Zakāh; الزكاة، المجتمع المسلم الهندي، التوزيع الفع ال، الفقر، تقنية سلاسل الكتل","","","","","Samsung Xiaomi Lead Indian Smartphone Market in Q3 2023, (2023); Ahmed, Istiaque, Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Philanthropic Charity for Social Good, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 1, (2024); Zakat and Economic Empowerment of Indian Muslims; International Journal of Zakat and Islamic Philanthropy Issues, (2020); National Zakat Survey Secure and Efficient Addressing Prevalent Issues Such as Fraud and Mismanagement A Blockchain Based Model Involving Muzakki Donors Zakh Institutions and Mustahiqeens Beneficiaries can Streamline Transactions While Ensuring Compliance with Islamic Principles Through Smart Contracts Blockchains Secure Immutable Ledger Fosters Trust and Reduces Fraud Indias Growing Internet Accessibility Robust Mobile Connectivity and Initiatives Like Digital India Create A Favorable Environment for Blockchain Integration Collaborative Efforts Among Stakeholders are Vital for Successful Implementation by Modernizing Zakh Practices Blockchain can Enhance Transparency Efficiency and Impact Increasing Charitable Contributions Promoting Social Equity and Advancing the Socio Economic Development of Indias Muslim Community Through Improved Education Healthcare and Self Employment Opportunities, (2020); Amp Zakat Fund Project Facts Figures, (2023); Blockchain Cryptocurrency Laws and Regulations 2024, (2024); Convergence of Crowd Funding and Zakat System in India an Integrated Approach for Human Welfare, (2020); Choiriyah, Evi Aninatin Ni’matul, ZAKAT AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN INDONESIA: A PANEL ANALYSIS AT PROVINCIAL LEVEL, Journal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance, 6, 4, pp. 811-832, (2020); Churuangsuk, Chaitong, Low-carbohydrate diets for overweight and obesity: a systematic review of the systematic reviews, Obesity Reviews, 19, 12, pp. 1700-1718, (2018)","","King Abdulaziz University Scientific Publishing Center","","","","","","16584244; 10187383","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000357017"

Based on qualitative interviews, findings reveal that lenders exhibit a positive attitude toward P2P lending, driven by opportunistic investment decisions, the perception of relatively low-risk investments, and the availability of disposable income. This attitude is further reinforced by the accessibility of investment-related information on digital platforms. Beyond individual motivations, social influence plays a crucial role, as family members and digital influencers significantly impact lenders' investment choices. Additionally, perceived behavioral control in digital investment environments is shaped not only by regulatory structures and platform transparency but also by decentralized information sources, investment flexibility, and experiential learning. These findings emphasize the transformative role of digital finance in shaping investor autonomy and risk perception.

However, unlike credit cards and other well-established digital payment services and solutions, digital currencies bring new and complex challenges for the economies, including legal and regulatory implications. Private cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have impacted the financial system primarily as a speculative trading instrument. However, with the emergence of central bank digital currencies, digital money has the potential to revolutionise the payment system, since its features can assure the stability needed for a transactional currency. In this context, tax administrations will be affected both on policy and operational aspects.

Recognizing the importance of global factors in financial market interdependencies, this research also assesses their impacts on tail risk connections. Empirical findings reveal varying levels of total connectedness among DeFi assets, sukuk markets, and Islamic equity indexes across different time spans, indicating a moderate but fluctuating degree of integration. DeFi assets generally appear disconnected from sukuk and Islamic stock markets over various periods, with the notable exception of a strong and consistent link between SNX in the DeFi sector and sukuk markets (excluding the Indonesian market) over medium- and long-term durations, suggesting that both DeFi and Islamic assets have hedging capabilities. Additionally, the integration between DeFi and Islamic assets is weaker during the COVID-19 era compared to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict period, with changes in the transmission mechanism. Further analysis identifies several potential predictors of tail risk connectedness between DeFi and Islamic assets.

The study involved VOSviewer and Harzing's publish or perish as the main tools for data analysis. A total of 100 journal articles and reviews were analysed using keyword co-occurrence analysis and bibliographic coupling to identify several themes within the context of Halal supply chain management. The keyword co-occurrence analysis produced six themes, including “consumer behaviour and the application of blockchain in Halal supply chain”, “bibliometric analysis and literature review in the Halal food supply chain”, and “Islam and Halal logistics in Malaysia”. While bibliographic coupling produced seven themes, such as “food integrity and blockchain in Halal supply chain management”, and “the analysis of Halal logistics and supply chains on aspects such as adoption of Halal logistics, challenges and opportunities, service quality, and consumer behaviour”. Despite its limitations, the study highlights the novel insights and knowledge gaps on aspects linked to Halal supply chain management.

This cluster provides crucial theme that address aspects of sustainability, risks and barriers towards Halal supply chains. This is relevant, as almost all parts of the world have supply chains that are vulnerable to numerous risks that need to be addressed for the players and chains to remain efficient. Haleem et al. (2021) establishes that Halal products in India with Halal labels are perceived to be crucial for customers involved in Halal supply chains. The study emphasizes the embedding of sustainability in Halal supply chains, highlighting the importance of balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects. This balance is crucial for maintaining integrity and ensuring Halal assurance. Regarding risk assessment, Khan et al. (2021a, 2021b) present risks that affect Halal supply chains in different facets such as production, planning, logistics and outsourcing. These studies call for more efforts toward effective management of identified Halal supply chain risks. Therefore, customers and businesses in Halal supply chains also encounter some risks that they should consider for proper decision making. It has been reported that supply-related risks are the most common that affect Halal food supply chains. On the other hand, the cluster includes studies on aspects of barriers towards Halal supply chains. Understanding these barriers is crucial for effectively addressing challenges and optimizing operations in this specialized sector. Khan, Khan, and Haleem (2022) point out several barriers in Halal SCM which include diminishing demand for Halal products, inadequate laws regulating the Halal industry and the absence of a policy framework. These barriers are regarded as main obstacles that hinder the efficient Halal SCM. Furthermore, Khan et al. (2019) identify barriers to Halal certification, which include inadequate support from the top management, lack of consumer awareness, and an inadequate number of Halal certifying professionals, among others. Thus, the cluster provides a basis for concentrating on the improvement of sustainability in Halal supply chains and providing mitigation strategies for managing risks and barriers, especially in Halal food supply chains.The researcher expresses gratitude to the University of Dodoma for its support in enhancing research activities.

The historical depreciation of the currency has also hampered economic growth and fiscal stability. Traditional economic wisdom suggests that services generate fewer well-paying jobs compared to production, but a novel concept called the ‘supply chain economy’ challenges this notion. This research delves into the supply chain’s response to inflation and exchange rate volatility in Ghana, where an 8% inflation target guides monetary policy to curb expenses, reduce poverty, and sustain economic growth. Employing statistical methods like generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and autoregressive distributed lag co-integration, the study explores the relationship between exchange rates and inflation. It reveals that variables like GDP, foreign direct investment, private market loans, and infrastructure spending significantly impact export efficiency in both the short and long-term. Additionally, including imports from the manufacturing industry results in negative inflation. This research provides valuable insights into the entire supply chain within domestic and international economies, particularly in the context of economic variables’ influence on procurement supply chain dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","exchange rate volatility; GDP; gross domestic product; import; inflation; procurement data; procurement entities","","","","","Economic Research, (2018); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, The hedging effectiveness of industrial metals against different oil shocks: Evidence from the four newly developed oil shocks datasets, Resources Policy, 69, (2020); African Journal of Accounting Economics Finance and Banking Research, (2008); Adjasi, Charles Komla Delali, Macroeconomic uncertainty and conditional stock-price volatility in frontier African markets: Evidence from Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 10, 4, pp. 333-349, (2009); Adom, Philip Kofi, Analysing inflation dynamics in Ghana, African Development Review, 27, 1, pp. 1-13, (2015); Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal, (2019); International Business Research, (2013); International Journal of Business and Management, (2010); Developing Country Studies, (2013); Journal of Applied Finance and Banking, (2012)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","17466482; 17466474","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018616334"

Given the ever-evolving landscape where financial institutions embrace digital technologies while integrating sustainability principles into their operations, it is essential to examine the interplay of both trends in enhancing the transparency and accuracy of their financial reporting. Method: data were collected from the banking professionals in Jordan using a structured questionnaire. The responses of two hundred and four valid respondents were analyzed accordingly using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). It tested the relationships of digitization, SDG integration, and the quality of electronic financial reporting. Results: the results indicate that digitalization and SDG integration positively affect the quality of electronic financial reports. On the other hand, SDG integration (Coefficient = 0,214) was more substantial than digitalization (Coefficient = 0,150), which indicates that good governance, environmental, and social improvements add value to financial reporting by providing more transparency and accuracy. Moreover, these digital technologies facilitate the finance departments’ data governance, reporting, and regulatory compliance. Conclusions: this study contributes to the literature on the importance of digitalization and sustainability integration for SME financial reporting in Jordanian banks. Banks that adopt digital tools and align with SDGs are also better prepared to meet stakeholder expectations and comply with regulatory requirements. Further research can investigate these factors in determining the long-term economic sustainability of these variables and how they ultimately shape the financial reporting standards of these developing economies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit; ESG; Financial Reports; FinTech; ODS; SmartPLS4; Sustainability","Banking; Decentralized finance; Digital devices; Economics; Fintech; Integration; Least squares approximations; Regulatory compliance; Audit; Banking sectors; Developing nations; Digital technologies; ESG; Financial institution; Financial reporting; Financial reports; ODS; Smartpls4; Sustainable development","","","","Effect of Financial Technology Adoption on Performance of Commercial Banks in Meru County Kenya, (2023); Gilchrist, David J., Barriers to the Usefulness of Non-profit Financial Statements: Perspectives From Key Internal Stakeholders, Australian Accounting Review, 33, 2, pp. 188-202, (2023); Morched, Salim, The impact of innovation type on the performance and social responsibility of French manufacturing companies, Environment Systems and Decisions, 43, 3, pp. 433-452, (2023); Int J Innov Res Sci Stud, (2025); Saleh, Isam Hamad, Big Data analytics and financial reporting quality: qualitative evidence from Canada, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 21, 1, pp. 83-104, (2023); International Journal of Advanced Research in Engineering and Technology, (2020); Shatnawi, Mahmoud Zayed Ibrahim, Corporate environmental responsibility and corporate performance in Jordan, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 12, 1, pp. 307-314, (2024); Digital Financial Services, (2020); Universal Journal of Global Human Resource Studies, (2024); Aloqaily, Ahmad Nader, The mediating effect of green culture on the relationship between GHRM and green sustainable performance in Jordanian SME logistics companies, International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 11, 10, pp. 232-240, (2024)","","AG Editor (Argentina)","","","","","","29534917","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018098698"

With the growing reliance on digital banking and cloud technologies, understanding how e-learning can enhance the effectiveness of these services and improve consumer perception is crucial. The research focuses on examining these variables in the context of Islamic banking, where service quality is often directly linked to customer satisfaction and competitive advantage. Method: to achieve the study’s goal, data was collected from e-banking consumers using a structured survey. The researchers applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS software to analyze the relationships between cloud services, service quality, and competitive service quality, while also examining the moderating role of consumer e-learning. The data sample was obtained from banking consumers in a single country, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Results: the results of the study indicated that: Cloud services have a significant positive impact on competitive service quality, Service quality has a significant positive impact on competitive service quality, the study’s primary contribution was the confirmation of the moderating effect of consumer e-learning. E-learning in the context of consumer education was found to enhance the relationship between cloud services, service quality, and competitive service quality, making it a key factor for improving customer experiences. Conclusions: the study underscores the importance of consumer e-learning in enhancing the quality and competitiveness of cloud services in Islamic banks. However, certain limitations exist, such as the small sample size and the study being confined to only one country. To build on these findings, future research is recommended to include a larger sample size from diverse geographical regions and consider conducting longitudinal studies to assess the pre-and post-learning effects of consumer education on service quality and competitiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud Services; Competitive Service Quality; Islamic Banks; Jordan; Service Quality","Banking; Competition; Customer satisfaction; E-learning; Engineering education; Cloud services; Competitive service quality; Competitive services; Consumer education; E - learning; Islamic bank; Jordan; Quality services; Service Quality; Quality of service","","","","Abedifar, Pejman, Heterogeneous market structure and systemic risk: Evidence from dual banking systems, Journal of Financial Stability, 33, pp. 96-119, (2017); Abror, Abror, Service quality, religiosity, customer satisfaction, customer engagement and Islamic bank’s customer loyalty, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 11, 6, pp. 1691-1705, (2020); Land and Architecture, (2025); Abdallah Alalwan, Ali Abdallah, Examining factors influencing Jordanian customers’ intentions and adoption of internet banking: Extending UTAUT2 with risk, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 40, pp. 125-138, (2018); Environmental Research and Ecotoxicity, (2024); Alenezi, Abdullah Khretan, The role of e-learning materials in enhancing teaching and learning behaviors, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 1, pp. 48-56, (2020); Alghadi, Mohammad Yousef, The influence of some fintech service on the performance of Islamic bank in Jordan, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 8, 1, pp. 393-400, (2024); International Journals of Academic Research World, (2024); Hamada, Abbas Saad, Operating cash flow, corporate governance, and sustainable dividend payouts, International Journal of Entrepreneurship, 22, 4 Specialissue, (2018); Almasarweh, Mohammad Salameh, The impacts of task technology fit, transparency, and supply chain agility on the blockchain adoption by SMEs in Jordan, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 3, pp. 1303-1310, (2023)","","AG Editor (Argentina)","","","","","","29534917","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018042767"

This study uses a doctrinal legal approach. The findings show that notaries have the authority to prepare authentic deeds for Islamic banking contracts. These deeds serve as strong legal evidence in resolving disputes in the context of Islamic banking. The responsibility of notaries in preparing Islamic banking agreements includes three legal aspects. First, under civil law, Article 84 of the Notary Law outlines the civil liability of notaries. Second, under administrative law, Article 85 of the Notary Law provides that if a notary makes an error when drafting a deed, they may be subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with the Notary Law and its implementing regulations. Third, in terms of criminal law, if a notary commits an act that constitutes a criminal offense as defined in the Criminal Code, they may face criminal sanctions accordingly.

Despite the country’s tremendous technical improvements, use of internet banking remains low. A questionnaire study was conducted with 384 genuine internet banking customers in Saudi Arabia. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed the variables’ underlying structure, whereas confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 22 confirmed reliability and validity. Structural equation modelling (SEM) in AMOS 22 was used to examine 22 hypotheses. According to the findings, perceived utility, perceived simplicity of use, convenience, and website design all had a favourable effect on trust and satisfaction, which in turn promoted online banking uptake. However, security had no meaningful effect on trust or satisfaction. The mediation study found that trust and contentment had a role in mediating the association between perceived utility, perceived ease of use, convenience, and website design and online banking uptake. Surprisingly, neither trust nor contentment mediated the association between security and adoption. The study model explained 62% of the variation in online banking usage. These results help us understand the critical roles of trust and happiness in online banking adoption in Saudi Arabia, and they provide significant insights for the banking industry to enhance consumer adoption strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Online Banking Adoption; Perceived Ease of Use; Satisfaction; Saudi Arabia; Security; Trust","","","","","Abdennebi, Hela Ben, M-banking adoption from the developing countries perspective: A mediated model, Digital Business, 3, 2, (2023); Abdul Sathar, Meharaj Banu, A moderated-mediation model of perceived enjoyment, security and trust on customer satisfaction: evidence from banking industry in India, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 17, 3, pp. 656-679, (2023); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., Customer attitudes towards online shopping: A systematic review of the influencing factors, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 1, pp. 513-524, (2023); Bani Ahmad, Ahmad Y.A., Assessment of Blockchain-Based Accounting Technology on Accounting Report Efficiency Among Business Operators in Jordan, Technical and Vocational Education and Training, 39, pp. 141-151, (2024); Ahmad, Iftikhar Ali, Guardians of the vault: unmasking online threats and fortifying e-banking security, a systematic review, Journal of Financial Crime, 31, 6, pp. 1485-1501, (2024); Impact of Customer Loyalty on Organizational Performance in Some Selected Publishing Companies in South Western Nigeria, (2024); Akhter, Ayeasha, Determining factors of intention to adopt internet banking services: A study on commercial bank users in Bangladesh, Banks and Bank Systems, 17, 1, pp. 125-136, (2022); Alarifi, Areej Abdulrahman, The influence of Internet banking services quality on e-customers’ satisfaction of Saudi banks: comparison study before and during COVID-19, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 40, 2, pp. 496-516, (2023); Sanaa University Journal of Applied Sciences and Technology, (2024); Albarq, Abbas N., The emergence of mobile payment acceptance in Saudi Arabia: the role of reimbursement condition, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 15, 6, pp. 1632-1650, (2024)","","Econjournals","","","","","","21464405","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014280632"

The takaful market is currently facing low penetration due to several challenges, including regulatory compliance, payment efficiency, fraud prevention, and transparency. Blockchain technology, a decentralised, transparent and trust-based system, could address these issues efficiently and effectively by offering smart contracts. This paper examines the feasibility of Blockchain and its impact on Pakistan’s insurance market, in general, and the takaful sector, in particular, using a systematic literature review (SLR) and case studies from Malaysia, the UAE, and Indonesia. In Malaysia and the UAE, the success of using Blockchain in Islamic finance highlights potential efficiency and security benefits. However, in Pakistan's regulatory ambiguity, lack of Shariah-compliant frameworks, limited human expertise, and low industry readiness are a few factors that need to be addressed by the Government of Pakistan. This could lead to sustainable growth in Pakistan’s digital financial sector, including the takaful industry. Policymakers, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the State Bank of Pakistan could benefit from this study by establishing a regulatory sandbox and providing current takaful operators with comprehensive IT and regulatory support to develop Shariah-compliant smart contracts. The results reveal that Takaful operators should develop and test pilot digital projects focusing on cost reduction, fraud prevention, and the automation of standard claims where possible. This will streamline the insurance industry and Takaful operations, leading to not only increased Takaful penetration but also helping the Pakistani Takaful market align with global digital trends. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; insurance; Shariah in Pakistan; smart contracts; Takaful","","","","","Abdeen, Mohammad A.R., Employing Takaful islamic banking through state of the art blockchain: A case study, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 10, 12, pp. 648-654, (2019); Akhtar, Tahir, Blockchain technology enterprises’ ownership structure and cash holdings, Sustainable Futures, 8, (2024); Alam, Nafis, Fintech and Islamic finance: Digitalization, development and disruption, pp. 1-178, (2019); International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology, (2019); Al-Mutar, Firas Hammoodi Neanah, Providing scalability and privacy for smart contract in the healthcare system, Optik, 271, (2022); International Business Logistics, (2024); Bagloee, Saeed Asadi, Blockchain: The operating system of smart cities, Cities, 112, (2021); Chowdhury, Mohammad Jabed Morshed, A survey on blockchain-based platforms for IoT use-cases, Knowledge Engineering Review, 35, (2020); Digiworld Economic Journal, (2016); Gorkhali, Anjee, Blockchain: a literature review, Journal of Management Analytics, 7, 3, pp. 321-343, (2020)","","RITHA Publishing House","","","","","","29718317","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011304308"

Regulatory fragmentation among member states, along with limited oversight, hampers the effective enforcement of core Sharia prohibitions such as riba (usury), gharar (uncertainty), and non-transparent transactions in digital commerce. This inconsistency risks undermining consumer trust and hindering the growth of Islamic digital markets across the region. This study explores the incorporation of Sharia principles into e-commerce regulations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore through a qualitative comparative policy analysis, document review, and expert interviews. Findings indicate that Malaysia and Brunei have developed more mature regulatory frameworks that explicitly embed Sharia norms, whereas Indonesia and Singapore encounter structural and technical barriers to similar integration. Moreover, emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts show promise in enhancing transparency and facilitating Sharia compliance. This article contributes to the discourse by recommending the establishment of an ASEAN-level coordinating body to harmonize Sharia-compliant e-commerce regulations and develop adaptable guidelines for member states. Such an institutional approach is vital for fostering regulatory coherence, enhancing market confidence, and supporting the sustainable development of Islamic digital finance. Future research should focus on leveraging advanced digital technologies to operationalize Sharia compliance across ASEAN’s digital economy.Perkembangan pesat e-commerce di ASEAN menawarkan potensi ekonomi yang besar namun juga menghadirkan tantangan mendesak dalam mengintegrasikan prinsip-prinsip Syariah ke dalam kerangka regulasi. Fragmentasi regulasi antarnegara anggota, disertai dengan pengawasan yang terbatas, menghambat penegakan efektif larangan-larangan utama Syariah seperti riba (bunga), gharar (ketidakpastian), dan transaksi yang tidak transparan dalam perdagangan digital. Ketidakkonsistenan regulasi ini berisiko merusak kepercayaan konsumen dan pertumbuhan pasar digital Islam di kawasan tersebut. Penelitian ini mengkaji sejauh mana prinsip Syariah telah diintegrasikan dalam regulasi e-commerce di Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, dan Singapura melalui analisis kebijakan komparatif kualitatif, tinjauan dokumen, dan wawancara ahli. Hasil menunjukkan bahwa Malaysia dan Brunei telah mengembangkan kerangka regulasi yang lebih matang dengan secara eksplisit memasukkan norma-norma Syariah, sementara Indonesia dan Singapura menghadapi hambatan struktural dan teknis dalam integrasi serupa. Selain itu, teknologi baru seperti blockchain dan smart contract menunjukkan potensi besar dalam meningkatkan transparansi dan memfasilitasi kepatuhan Syariah. Artikel ini memberikan kontribusi dengan merekomendasikan pembentukan lembaga koordinasi tingkat ASEAN untuk menyelaraskan regulasi e-commerce yang sesuai Syariah serta mengeluarkan pedoman yang dapat disesuaikan bagi negara anggota. Pendekatan kelembagaan ini sangat penting untuk mendorong konsistensi regulasi, meningkatkan kepercayaan pasar, dan mendukung pengembangan berkelanjutan keuangan digital Islam.

Using VOSviewer software, this study focuses on analysing the relevant research and published articles indexed in Scopus by employing bibliometric methodology. The data were obtained from search results of documents indexed by Scopus until 2023. There are 67 publications consisting of 24 book chapters, 18 articles, 11 conference papers, eight books, five reviews, and one conference review. The results indicate that the number of publications on blockchain in Islamic finance increased significantly in the year 2022. Employing Network Visualization, the study identifies five distinct clusters within this field. Cluster one investigates the integration of blockchain and smart contracts in Islamic crowdfunding, while cluster two delves into blockchain integration in financial services. Cluster three explores the role of fintech in advancing financial inclusion, cluster four focuses on Islamic fintech innovations, and cluster five centres on the geographic distribution of studies. These clusters align with the principles and challenges of Islamic finance and their implications for key stakeholders, including financial institutions, regulators, and technology providers, as well as connect to discourse on technological innovation and Sharia-compliant financial solutions. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first to use bibliometric analysis to assess blockchain in Islamic finance.

Nevertheless, the industry faces challenges in achieving operational efficiency, ensuring transparency, and promoting financial inclusion. Industry 4.0 (IR4.0) technologies—namely Blockhain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT)—offer innovative solutions to address these issues. These technologies optimise resource utilisation, enhance operational transpacrency, and foster customer trust by ensuring compliance with Halal and ethical standards. This study underscores the importance of integrating IR4.0 technologies into the Halal industry with Islamic Monetary Economics (IME) principles, particularly in promoting financial inclusion, ethical procurement, and sustainability. Employing the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework, this study integrates Economic Sustainability (Financial Inclusion), Social Equity (Maslahah), and Environmental Stewardship (Tayyib) into a comprehensive model that connects IR4.0 technologies with the maqasid al-Shariah. By prioritising the preservation of faith, life, intellect, progeny, and wealth, this model positions the Halal industry as a global leader in ethical and sustainable economic development. This study employs a qualitative research design, appropriate for addressing the selected research topics and issues. The findings highlight the urgent need for stakeholders—businesses, regulators, and consumers—to embrace technological innovations and adapt to the evolving global commerce landscape. By taking proactive measures, stakeholders can harness IR4.0’s potential to shape a prosperous and inclusive future for the Halal industry and its communities. Ultimately, this study emphasises the sector’s potential to drive economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability, shaping a more inclusive and prosperous future for the communities it serves. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Halal industry; IR4.0 technologies; Islamic monetary economics; sustainability","","","","This study is funded by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) of Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/SS02/USIM/ 02/2).","Rejeb, Abderahman, Halal food supply chains: A literature review of sustainable measures and future research directions, Foods and Raw Materials, 9, 1, pp. 106-116, (2021); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); Journal of Islamic Marketing, (2023); Sustainability, (2020); International Journal of Islamic Business Ethics, (2020); Journal of Islamic, (2019); Barbosa, Marcelo Werneck, Managing supply chain resources with Big Data Analytics: a systematic review, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 21, 3, pp. 177-200, (2018); Billah, Arif, Factors influencing Muslim and non-Muslim consumers’ consumption behavior: A case study on halal food, Journal of Foodservice Business Research, 23, 4, pp. 324-349, (2020); Afr J Sociol Psychol Stud, (2022); International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Arts, (2023)","","Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","","","","","","25904396; 19857454","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006730440"

As more start-ups enter the market with digital currencies and blockchain technology, it is necessary to relate them to Islamic ethics and legal frameworks. This article explores the fundamentals of Islamic finance principles, including the banned aspects of riba (usury), gharar (uncertainty), and maysir (gambling or games of chance), as a way of examining how cryptocurrencies relate to or violate these principles. It also evaluates the potential of blockchain technology to promote transparency, fairness, and ethical practices in financial transactions, aligning with the guidance in the Qur'an on justice and equity in business dealings. The article argues for the development of specific standards that define Shari'ah-compliant financial assets. It analyses numerous cases of cryptocurrencies that sought to comply with these standards, examining the legal and regulatory aspects, coupled with the general potential of blockchain utilisation in the gradual further developments in Islamic finance in the risk-sharing models like mudarabah (profit-loss sharing business) and musharakah (joint enterprise or partnership). The article concludes that the prospects of blockchain technology are vast for Islamic finance, but the use of this technology in coins needs continuous legal and ethical appraisal in relation to its Shari'ah compliance. The article suggests further developments in this regard and specific recommendations for public policy development to set the international legal framework for Shari'ah-compliant digital assets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Digital Assets; Islamic Finance; Shari'ah Compliance","","","","","Rahman, S.

Within the framework of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, which encompasses approximately 72 countries—nearly half of which are predominantly Muslim—it is essential to recognize the significance of product integrity and authenticity. Given the substantial market potential in these regions, stakeholders must focus on meeting the demand for nutritional halal foods. This approach not only satisfies consumers’ religious requirements but also fosters trust and loyalty within this diverse demographic. An online survey consisting of two segments was conducted, and responses were analyzed using STATA version 16. The survey was disseminated through email, Facebook, and WhatsApp, resulting in a total of 435 responses, of which 399 were deemed complete and suitable for analysis. In the second segment, 279 respondents were evaluated, comprising 18 producers, 33 intermediaries, 70 wholesalers, and 158 retailers, to assess the growing market demand for nutritional halal foods and understand prevailing business trends. The results reveal that a 1-unit increase in the availability of product video links leads to a 63.4% increase in customer demand, while a 1-unit increase in customer belief and satisfaction results in increases of 23.3 and 5% in demand, respectively, highlighting the importance of transparency, religious compliance, and consumer trust in driving demand for halal products. The initial analysis of consumer behavior in OBOR Muslim countries, followed by a thorough examination of producers, intermediaries, wholesalers, and retailers, provides valuable insights into the projected growth in demand for Halal food. With an estimated 1.9 billion Muslims constituting approximately 25.01% of the global population—and 92% residing in OBOR nations—it is evident that halal dietary principles transcend national boundaries. By implementing strategic policies, stakeholders, including policymakers and firm managers, can optimize their efforts to meet the nutritional demands of this expansive market. Furthermore, this study identifies the need for additional exploration into related aspects such as sustainable traceability of quality halal products, brand image clarity, and consumer awareness of supply chain operations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","food quality certification; halal food demand; intelligent manufacturing; OBOR; sustainable marketing strategy","","","","","Bradley, Peter, An Institutional Economics Framework to Explore Sustainable Production and Consumption, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 1317-1339, (2021); Mohsin, Muhammad, How external debt led to economic growth in South Asia: A policy perspective analysis from quantile regression, Economic Analysis and Policy, 72, pp. 423-437, (2021); Zailani, Suhaiza Hanim Binti Dato Mohamad, Drivers of halal orientation strategy among halal food firms, British Food Journal, 117, 8, pp. 2143-2160, (2015); Asioli, Daniele, Do consumers value food products containing upcycled ingredients?

However, they also pose significant challenges to long-term sustainability. While the existing literature provides valuable insights into their influence, a broader scope is necessary to reflect their role in advancing sustainable finance. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of 2,446 publications from the Web of Science (1996–2024) to map the evolving nexus between emerging technologies and finance. Our findings reveal an expanding research landscape, with key themes including the application of emerging technologies in solving financial problems, the integration of technologies with behavioural and regulatory frameworks, financial innovation for promoting development, risk management and financial stability, digital currencies and blockchain, digital transformation challenges, and sustainable finance. The analysis highlights the dual nature of emerging technologies: while they enhance financial efficiency, transparency, and inclusion, and offer significant opportunities to advance sustainable finance, they also introduce risks such as cybersecurity threats, algorithmic bias, regulatory challenges, and critical barriers to long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, we propose a research agenda prioritizing ethical governance, stress-testing AI models under economic crises, securing decentralized systems, mitigating greenwashing risks, and fostering globally aligned regulatory standards. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to tackle ethical, security, and inclusivity concerns. It is imperative for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions to align technological innovation with sustainability objectives to ensure that advancements contribute to the development of an equitable, resilient, and inclusive financial ecosystem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; bibliometric analysis; Business, Management and Accounting; Economics; Emerging technologies; Finance; fintech; sustainable finance","","","","","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Quantile price convergence and spillover effects among Bitcoin, Fintech, and artificial intelligence stocks, International Review of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-205, (2023); Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Blockchain market and eco-friendly financial assets: Dynamic price correlation, connectedness and spillovers with portfolio implications, International Review of Economics and Finance, 87, pp. 218-243, (2023); Gsc Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Asia Pacific Management Accounting Journal, (2021); Aboelfotoh, Ahmed, Examining the ability of big data analytics to investigate financial reporting quality: a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 23, 2, pp. 444-471, (2025); Abramo, Giovanni, The suitability of h and g indexes for measuring the research performance of institutions, Scientometrics, 97, 3, pp. 555-570, (2013); Abramo, Giovanni, Citations versus journal impact factor as proxy of quality: Could the latter ever be preferable?, Scientometrics, 84, 3, pp. 821-833, (2010); Abu Afifa, Malik Muneer, Blockchain adoption in accounting by an extended UTAUT model: empirical evidence from an emerging economy, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 21, 1, pp. 5-44, (2023); Acheampong, Albert, Does soft information determine credit risk?

Despite their importance, female entrepreneurs continue to face significant challenges. Previous research has looked into the factors that influence the success of female entrepreneurs, but there are few studies on how these factors interact, especially with digital government support. This study aims to bridge this gap by using total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) to investigate the role of digital government in increasing female entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia. A literature review identified eight critical success factors (CSFs): digital government, family background, entrepreneurial attitude, start-up intent, social networks, self-efficacy, dynamic capabilities, and digital innovation. The study contributes to entrepreneurial self-efficacy, social capital, and institutional theories by incorporating these CSFs into a strategic framework. The findings have significant policy implications, particularly for Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to promote digital government assistance and sustainable female entrepreneurship. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Government; Female Entrepreneurship; Saudi Arabia; Strategic Framework; TISM","Electronic voting; Public policy; Digital government; Female entrepreneurs; Female entrepreneurship; Interpretive structural models; Modeling approach; Performance; Saudi Arabia; Strategic frameworks; Success factors; Total interpretive structural modeling; Economic and social effects","","","","Abdelwahed, Nadia Abdelhamid Abdelmegeed, Women, Entrepreneurship, and Sustainability: The Case of Saudi Arabia, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 18, (2022); Abed, Salma S., Understanding the Determinants of Using Government AI-Chatbots by Citizens in Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Electronic Government Research, 20, 1, (2024); Adikaram, Arosha S., Femininity penalty: challenges and barriers faced by STEM woman entrepreneurs in an emerging economy, Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies, 15, 5, pp. 1113-1138, (2023); Afshan, Gul, Learning experiences of women entrepreneurs amidst COVID-19, International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship, 13, 2, pp. 162-186, (2021); Ahmad, Muhammad Ishfaq, Small and medium enterprises dynamic capabilities efficacy during COVID-19: moderating role of CEO gender, Review of International Business and Strategy, 33, 1, pp. 5-17, (2023); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alhajri, Abrar, Female digital entrepreneurship: a structured literature review, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research, 30, 2-3, pp. 369-397, (2024); Alomar, Jawaher Abdulrahman, Assessing Factors Influencing Female Entrepreneurship Intentions and Behaviour, FIIB Business Review, (2023); Alryalat, Mohammad A.A., Understanding Factors Influencing Citizens' Intentions to Use Electronic Government (e-Gov) Services: A Case of Jordan, International Journal of Electronic Government Research, 20, 1, (2024); Amofah, Kwaku, Impact of attitude towards entrepreneurship education and role models on entrepreneurial intention, Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 11, 1, (2022)","","IGI Global","","","","","","15483894; 15483886","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004561521"

In particular, immersive and decentralized platforms are reshaping transaction dynamics by offering new levels of interactivity. However, with these innovations come substantial challenges, especially those related to ensuring secure, energy-efficient, and interoperable asset flows across domains. Motivated by these needs, this article present a transaction framework that is designed to balance scalability and sustainability. Specifically, we combine the relay chain–parachain architecture with chameleon hash signatures (CHSs) to construct a mechanism capable of handling cross-domain digital content exchange. The proposed design aims to support flexible asset handling while keeping computation and energy demands in check. Taking inspiration from green supply chain management (GSCM), the framework also reflects concerns about sustainable digital asset governance. To evaluate its practicality, we carried out experiments across various network conditions and transaction volumes. The evaluation results suggest that our framework maintains low latency and reasonable energy efficiency, all while ensuring secure and interoperable transactions in the Metaverse context. These findings point to the potential of the framework as a stable infrastructure for digital asset management at scale in future decentralized environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence-based Internet of Things (AIoT); green supply chain management (GSCM); metaverse; network security","Asset management; AIoT; Block-chain; Decentralised; Digital assets; Energy efficient; Green supply chain management; Immersive; Interactivity; Metaverses; Networks security; Supply chain management","","","The work of Chien-Ming Chen was supported in part by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST, and in part by the Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Culture and Tourism for Research on the Application Technology of Metaverse Cultural Tourism Scenarios.

After analyzing different chaotic map types, this paper generates a new 1D chaotic system based on sin and logistic maps. After that, we derived a new map with quantum corrections by coupling a kicked quantum system with a harmonic oscillator bath. As the dissipation parameter increases, we observe a period-doubling progression towards classical behavior, along with other intriguing characteristics at intermediate parameter values. Then, this new chaotic system is applied to the Schnorr and Elgamal schemes. Extensive randomness tests were conducted, and the algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance. Following rigorous testing and analysis, the algorithm exhibited impressive signing and verification times of approximately 0.0000799212 (s) and 0.0000100223 (s) for the Schnorr scheme, and 0.000029932 (s) and 0.0000399298 (s) for the Elgamal scheme, respectively.

The current study focuses on the drivers of GenAI adoption and its consequences for both exploratory and exploitative innovation in FinTech companies. Purpose of the article: Based on a conceptual model that extends the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, this study also explores the moderating effect of ethical dilemmas in the relationship between GenAI adoption and innovation, as well as the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in shaping the broader impact of GenAI on organizational practices. Methods: Data were collected and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) from participants in the Chinese FinTech industry. Findings & value added: Our empirical findings show that GenAI improves both kinds of innovations and, subsequently, leads to improved organizational performance. However, ethical dilemmas do not significantly affect either of these effects. Moreover, the study sug-gests that aligning GenAI adoption with ESG goals, such as promoting sustainable practices and ensuring ethical governance, can further enhance long-term performance and stakeholder trust.

It presents the findings from a systematic review to better explain the pros and cons of utilizing these disruptive technologies for crowdsourcing and/or crowd-investing purposes. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodical protocol to search, screen, extract and scrutinize seventy-two (72) articles that were indexed in both Scopus and Web of Science. They examine their research questions, describe their methodologies. Afterwards, they synthesize the findings from previous literature, outline implications and discuss about future research avenues. Findings: A thorough review of the relevant literature suggests that there are opportunities as well as challenges for project initiators as well as for crowd-investors, if they are considering equity crowdfunding, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and rewards-based crowdfunding platforms, among others, to raise awareness about their projects and to access finance from crowd-investors. Research limitations/implications: Further research is required on this timely topic. There are a number of theories relating to technology adoption and/or innovation management, strategic management, accounting and financial reporting, and normative/business ethics, among other research areas, that can be utilized as theoretical bases, to explore this topic. Practical implications: Crowd-investors are striving in their endeavors to find a trade-off between risks and rewards associated with crowd-financing. Originality/value: Currently, there are few systematic reviews and conceptual articles focused on the crowdfunding of small businesses and startups. Hence this contribution closes this gap in the academic literature. Moreover, it links the extant theory to practice. It clarifies that the resource-based view theory of the firm, the theory of planned behavior, the diffusion of innovations theory as well as the signaling theory, among other conceptual frameworks, can be used to investigate different facets of crowdsourcing and crowd-investing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowd sourcing; Crowd-investing; Crowdfunding; Diffusion of innovations; Resource-based view; Signaling theory","","","","The authors thank the editor, guest editors and their reviewers, for their constructive remarks and suggestions.

This study aims to examine the effect of investment risk (IR), legal risk (LR), product knowledge (PK), Sharia compliance (SC) and subjective norm (SN) on investment decisions in businesses and projects run by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach: The questionnaires were distributed to prospective investors with prior knowledge of SCF and Islamic investment. The data collected was then examined using partial least square-structural equation modeling using SmartPLS 4.0. Findings: The results show that LR has positive and significant implications for supporting investment through SCF, while IR has the opposite. The main findings in this study explain that PK and SC are proven to strengthen the intention to invest in SCF. Meanwhile, SN, which also strengthens intention, is the greatest influence. Therefore, it is highly recommended that SCF organizers collaborate with regulators (OJK), universities, academics and the investor community, as well as Muslim entrepreneurs, to provide education and literacy regarding SCF products and the underlying contracts, along with the consequences and uniqueness of investment vis SCF. Practical implications: From a managerial side, Sharia expert educators can be appointed to increase investors’ literacy and confidence to support SMEs’ business expansion via SCF. In addition, to minimize investment risk, SCF organizers are also advised to issue sukuk and shares in different low-risk businesses/sectors, followed by investment amounts that are more affordable for novice investors. Originality/value: Research on SCF as an alternative to SME financing is still scarce. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first research to empirically test the relationship between risk, SC, PK and SN on potential investors’ decisions to support SMEs through the SCF mechanism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Investment decision; Product knowledge; Risk; Securities crowdfunding; Sharia compliance; SMEs","","","","The author is grateful for the support from the Islamic Economics Program, Department of Economics and Development Studies, Faculty of Economics and Business, Diponegoro University which has assisted in funding and full of support so that this research can be completed well.","Shariah Standards Full Text of Shariaah Standards for Islamic Financial Institutions as at Safar 1439 A H November 2017 A D, (2017); Abdul Rahman, Rashidah Binti, Micro-entrepreneurs’ intention to use Islamic micro-investment model (IMIM) in Bangladesh, Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 172-188, (2016); Abramova, Svetlana, Perceived benefit and risk as multidimensional determinants of bitcoin use: A quantitative exploratory study, (2016); Aji, Hendy Mustiko, Investigating the determinants of online infaq intention during the COVID-19 pandemic: an insight from Indonesia, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 12, 1, pp. 1-20, (2021); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen, Icek, The prediction of behavior from attitudinal and normative variables, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 6, 4, pp. 466-487, (1970); Pitchay, Anwar Allah, Self-determination theory and individuals’ intention to participate in donation crowdfunding, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 15, 3, pp. 506-526, (2022); Anshari, Muhammad, Digital marketplace and FinTech to support agriculture sustainability, Energy Procedia, 156, pp. 234-238, (2019); Islamic Economic Studies, (2021); undefined, (2019)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17590841; 17590833","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190682786"

We use a quantitative method to examine how mandatory risk disclosure (MRD) and voluntary risk disclosure (VRD) impact return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) in Islamic banks operating in Jordan. Our results show that both MRD and VRD have a significant effect on FP of Islamic banks. Moreover, FinTech acts as a moderator in the connection between risk disclosure (MRD and VRD) and FP performance. The effect was compared before and after coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it shows that the COVID-19 has increased the effect of MRD and VRD on FP of Islamic banks.

Using systematic random sampling, 404 answers from 36 agent points were obtained with face-to-face interview technique. Structured equation modeling based on SmartPLS was used to analyze the data, and Hayes’ Process Macro for SPSS was used to look at the moderation. The findings showed that stimulus factors play a significant role in influencing organisms. Out of the two organism factors, trust only has a significant positive effect on brand loyalty as a response.

While these services may be regarded as FinTech, involving cryptocurrency as the major transaction currency has made these services potentially distinctive from other fiat-based FinTech services. Thus, the critical success factors of crypto-exchanges may not be identical to those of other fiat-based FinTech services. Grounded on theories related to FinTech and service varieties, we developed a survey and explored the role of different factors on users’ continuous intention of adopting the crypto-exchanges. Our results suggested that when users perceive specific crypto-exchange characteristics, they are more likely to adopt the exchange continuously. Combining previous literature, we name this set of factors “LAS-VICT principle”, including low user-burden, asset-light, scalability, variety, innovativeness, scalability, and transparency. However, users’ emphasis on factors may differ based on their cryptocurrency experience.

Based on a sample comprising the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 companies from 2016 to 2020, the findings indicate that, although there has been progress in corporate transparency concerning modern slavery, a significant gap persists in the reporting on the measurement and monitoring of the effectiveness of their policies. This may stem from powerful CEOs' desires to maintain a positive corporate image, leading to minimal disclosure of potentially damaging information. The fixed effects panel regression analysis reveals a negative relationship between CEO power (CEOP) and the extent of modern slavery disclosures (MSD), with a significant moderating effect observed when female board representation is substantial. This evidence suggests that female board members may challenge groupthink and introduce diverse perspectives that can alter the board's dynamics, potentially mitigating the negative impact of CEOP on issues like modern slavery disclosure by encouraging more ethical and collective decision-making. This research underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in addressing modern slavery and promoting more responsible business practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","board gender diversity; CEO power; modern slavery disclosures; sustainable development goals; UK","decision making; ethics; gender disparity; slavery; Sustainable Development Goal; United Kingdom","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by The British Academy, which funded this project through the Leverhulme Small Research Grant SRG22\\220712.

The results are as follows: (1) under normal market conditions, in long-run horizons there is a significant positive cross-spectral relationship between FinTech's positive volatilities and Stellar’s negative volatilities; (2) Stellar’s negative and positive volatilities exhibit the highest net spillovers at the lower and upper tails, respectively; and (3) the quantile-based causality results indicate that Bitcoin’s good (bad) volatilities can lead to bad (good) volatilities in all three smart technologies operating between normal and bull market conditions. Moreover, the Bitcoin industry’s negative volatilities have a bilateral cause-and-effect relationship with FinTech’s positive volatilities. By analyzing the second moment, we found that Bitcoin's negative volatilities are the only cause variable that generates FinTech's good volatility in a unidirectional manner. As for Stellar, only bad volatilities have the potential to signal good volatilities for cutting-edge technologies in some middle quantiles, whereas good volatilities have no significant effect. Hence, the trade-off between Bitcoin and cutting-edge technologies, especially FinTech-related advancements, appear more broadly and randomly compared with the Stellar-innovative technologies nexus. The findings provide valuable insights for FinTech companies, blockchain developers, crypto-asset regulators, portfolio managers, and high-tech investors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Financial technology; G17; Non-parametric quantile causality; O14; O32; Q55; Volatilities","","","","","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Quantile price convergence and spillover effects among Bitcoin, Fintech, and artificial intelligence stocks, International Review of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-205, (2023); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, How COVID-19 drives connectedness among commodity and financial markets: Evidence from TVP-VAR and causality-in-quantiles techniques, Resources Policy, 70, (2021); Agarwal, Yashasvi, Delivering high-tech, AI-based health care at Apollo Hospitals, Global Business and Organizational Excellence, 39, 2, pp. 20-30, (2020); Redefining Banking and Financial Industry Through the Application of Computational Intelligence, (2019); Ahluwalia, Saurabh, Blockchain technology and startup financing: A transaction cost economics perspective, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 151, (2020); Regulation of Fintech and Cryptocurrencies Fintech in Islamic Finance, (2019); Money, (2018); Ali, Muhammad Salek, Applications of Blockchains in the Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 2, pp. 1676-1717, (2019); Allen, Franklin, Fintech, Cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial Structural Transformation in China, Journal of International Money and Finance, 124, (2022); Almeida, Dora Maria Fortes, COVID-19 Effects on the Relationship between Cryptocurrencies: Can It Be Contagion?

We first examine the dynamic conditional correlation between gold-backed cryptocurrencies and NFTs and DeFi assets during the period 02/11/2021-05/01/2023. We thereafter assess the diversification potential of gold-backed cryptocurrencies against NFTand DeFi. To this end, we use the time-varying Student's copula to investigate the cross-markets linkages among different assets in dynamic fashion. We afterwards compute the optimal hedging ratios and effectiveness index to better explore the effectiveness of portfolio risk management. Our findings clearly show that the degree of dependence between gold-backed cryptocurrencies and NFT and DeFi tokens tends to vary over time. Our results also display that gold-backed cryptocurrencies act as suitable hedging (or diversifying) assets during normal times. Nevertheless, such assets can be considered as robust safe havens during the 2022 bear market for the most of NFT and DeFi assets. More specifically, PAXG and PMGT are found to be the best safe haven instruments for both NFT and DeFi tokens. DGX also serves as safe-haven assets for some NFT and DeFi assets, but with a lower risk-mitigation capacity compared to PAXG and PMGT. In most cases, DGX tends to act as a strong diversifier. Its hedging feature is only recorded for the NFT Protocol (xNFT) and the DeFi token Chainlink (LINK). Our results are of particular interest to investors and portfolio managers who search for safe havens to mitigate the risk of their NFT and DeFi portfolios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geopolitical event; Gold-backed cryptocurrencies; Health crisis; Hedge; Safe-haven","","","","","Proceedings of the 1st Universitas Kuningan International Conference on Social Science Environment and Technology Uniset 2020 12 December 2020 Kuningan West Java Indonesia, (2020); Finance Res Lett, (2021); Alam, Nafis, Fintech and Islamic finance: Digitalization, development and disruption, pp. 1-178, (2019); Applied Economics and Finance, (2022); Ali, Fahad, An examination of whether gold-backed Islamic cryptocurrencies are safe havens for international Islamic equity markets, Research in International Business and Finance, 63, (2022); Aloui, Chaker, Are Islamic gold-backed cryptocurrencies different?, Finance Research Letters, 39, (2021); Ante, Lennart, The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Market and Its Relationship with Bitcoin and Ethereum, FinTech, 1, 3, pp. 216-224, (2022); Baur, Dirk G., Is gold a hedge or a safe haven?

The study employed a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model, incorporating perceived security and personal innovativeness as independent variables, and trust as a moderating variable. A total of 391 responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling in SmartPLS software. The study’s findings indicate that factors such as effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived, and personal innovativeness positively affect users’ behavioral intention (BI) to use fintech services in the insurance industry. Moreover, BI positively influences the actual use (AU) of fintech services. Additionally, trust plays a positive moderating role between BI and AU. The results of this study have practical implications for academicians, researchers, insurance companies, and insurance regulatory bodies. Academicians and researchers can further explore the acceptance of fintech in developing countries based on these findings. Insurance companies and regulatory bodies can take necessary steps and formulate strategies to promote the adoption of fintech services in the insurance industry, considering the identified factors and the role of trust. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Effort expectancy; Facilitating conditions; Fintech services; Perceived security; Personal innovativeness; Social influence; Trust","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

The study is conducted within the theoretical framework of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The study utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the data collected from a sample of 364 professionals working in the field of Islamic banking. The results of our study suggest that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Social Influence are important factors in predicting individuals' Behavioural Intention to use Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, the presence of Facilitating Conditions further enhances the impact of these factors on individuals' actual Use Behaviour. Significantly, it was shown that Use Behaviour played a significant role in determining the perceived quality of financial reporting. Nevertheless, the study did not find empirical evidence to demonstrate the direct influence of Behavioural Intention on Financial Reporting Quality. This implies that the actual implementation of Artificial Intelligence is required to fully realize its advantages.

A total of 93 questionnaires from branch heads of Islamic banks were used in this study, and the data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) through descriptive-analytical methods. The findings indicated that AI has a significant influence on the effective application of CG in Islamic banks. The study also revealed that the Covid-19 Pandemic positively moderates the influence of AI on the effective application of CG in Islamic banks. The results of this study have implications for regulators and decision-makers in proposing new legislation to effectively apply CG in the Islamic banking sector, which can help protect public funds and limit cyber-attacks.

This paper examines how these common law jurisdictions have adapted to these challenges, integrating traditional legal frameworks with the distinct characteristics of blockchain, such as automation, decentralisation, and cost efficiency. Through an analysis of key legal cases, the study demonstrates the adaptability of common law in responding to technological innovations. A key focus is placed on the application of smart contracts in sectors such as Islamic finance, where both common law and Sharia law coexist. Malaysia and Singapore offer unique examples of legal pluralism, having successfully harmonised these legal systems even before the advent of smart contracts. The integration of smart contracts into these frameworks showcases the ability of these jurisdictions to balance innovation with tradition, effectively governing both conventional and digital transactions. However, the paper identifies significant legal uncertainties, particularly concerning the enforceability of smart contracts, mechanisms for dispute resolution, and the integration of digital assets into existing legal norms. Rather than advocating comprehensive reforms, the paper suggests targeted regulatory updates and strategic legal guidelines to address these issues. By adopting this approach, Malaysia and Singapore can strengthen their legal systems to fully harness the potential of blockchain and smart contracts. Through comparative analysis and empirical case law, the study highlights how these jurisdictions can remain at the forefront of legal and technological innovation in Southeast Asia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Common law; Digital assets; Legal uncertainties; Smart contracts","","","","","Information Communications Technology Law, (2017); Tcp Ip Illustrated, (1994); Li, Yinan, Design and management of a distributed hybrid energy system through smart contract and blockchain, Applied Energy, 248, pp. 390-405, (2019); Shariah Analysis of Bitcoin Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, (2018); Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks, (1997); Smart Contracts Building Blocks for Digital Markets, (1996); Kasatkina, Marina, DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM FOR SMART CONTRACTS, Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology, 16, 2, pp. 143-162, (2022); Journal of Dispute Resolution, (2019); Sklaroff, Jeremy M., Smart contracts and the cost of inflexibility, University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 166, 1, pp. 263-303, (2017); Mik, Eliza, Smart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity, Law, Innovation and Technology, 9, 2, pp. 269-300, (2017)","","University of Torino","","","","","","27857867","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213838665"

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a four-year ethnographic work from 2002 to 2006, as accessed and analysed by the researcher. The philosophy underpinning this ethnography is from Geertz’s “Common sense as a cultural system” (1975) and The Interpretation of Cultures (1973). Findings: This study finds the religious metaphors of “Halal and Haram is not Only on Food” and “Bank for All” are the anticipated conception that envisages the institution of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB), especially the perspective of the Shariah Supervisory Council and the struggles of the assistant managers. Research limitations/implications: The paper aligns with the concerns of McPhail et al. (2004) and calls for engagement in research projects on accounting and accountability related to theology but with an attempt to theorise the “engagement” within the components of human limitation and intelligence which require a narrative from the social and collective dimensions of the present and in the past. Practical implications: By using various objects as symbol, metaphor and memory, such as “counter”, “branch”, “advertising” and “food”, the paper encourages readers to understand the objects as temporalities brought into being by a common sense consciousness and within a historical Malay context; one in which Malaysia is a Muslim society and a by-product of colonialism. This interpretation allows the issues raised by BIMB to represent an authentic Malaysian voice rather than to be read merely as an adjunct to western accounting history. Originality/value: The paper explores the translations of concepts that the self probes and attempts to describe accountability, as well as how these translate into common sense. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accountability; Common sense; Geertz; Islam; Islamic bank; Malaysia; Religious conception","","","","The author is grateful to the Visiting Research Fellowship programme of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies (OCIS), University of Oxford, under the Asia-Pacific Interdisciplinary Research in Accounting 2007 Emerging Scholars Fund (Reference No: 4001996) and the Research University Grant Scheme of Universiti Putra Malaysia (Vote No: 91392) for enabling him to have the time and space to work further on the paper.

Design/methodology/approach: The Indonesian capital market offers a unique case of the integration of XBRL regulatory reporting between multiple regulators and a transfer from capital market regulation to state-level regulation. This study uses semi-structured interviews with key actors employed with Indonesian XBRL-regulatory bodies and listed companies (filers). Findings: External pressures, monitoring issues and tensions in the implementation process were instrumental in the theorisation and translation of XBRL in Indonesia. Specifically, the findings show that choices made with respect to XBRL regulation and implementation created tensions between XBRL reporting fulfilling a monitoring purpose and serving stakeholders’ interests. The findings also indicate that the Indonesian approach to XBRL regulation and implementation had distinct characteristics compared to XBRL implementation in other jurisdictions. Practical implications: This study emphasises the necessity for robust regulatory support and strict enforcement to navigate the complexities and tensions arising from a multi-regulatory approach. Additionally, it stresses the importance of firms’ readiness and expertise in XBRL as more sophisticated implementation strategies are considered. Originality/value: Using the analytical lens of theorisation and translation, the study provides a deeper understanding of how a globally diffused accounting technology was institutionalised and legitimised in a developing country. Specifically, this study explains why a conversion approach to XBRL implementation was favoured and how XBRL implementation and reporting were managed and coordinated between different Indonesian regulators. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing country; Indonesia; Institutional theory; Regulation; Theorisation; Translation; XBRL","","","","","Alles, Michael G., Will XBRL improve corporate governance?

The introduction of equity crowdfunding (ECF) has added a new dimension to alternative financing in Malaysia. Since its inception in 2015, ECF has seen widespread adoption, showcasing the pivotal role of ECF platforms in connecting fundraisers with investors, thereby aiding SMEs in securing funding and investors in attaining returns. This study investigated two aspects of financial management, namely financial analysis and reporting and financial planning and control (FPC). Performance was assessed using financial metrics (Model 1) and customer performance (CP) as a non-financial metric (Model 2). Surveys were digitally distributed to 231 respondents, representing issuers who had successfully raised ECF funds from 2016 to 2019. This “authority of the sender” tactic was employed to ensure that the survey reached the appropriate respondents. Ultimately, 92 respondents met the study’s criteria. The research drew on the theory of financial bricolage, utilising statistical tools like SPSS 20.0 and Smart-PLS 3.0. The findings indicated that Models 1 and 2 were compatible only with FPC. However, FPC had a negative impact on the CP metric, possibly due to FPC overlooking other factors that improve customer performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","authority of sender; business intelligence; Equity crowdfunding; online platform","","","","From the study\u2019s initial perspective, key differentiators between SMEs funded by ECF and those that do not include financial innovation, ownership in the investment firm, and reliance on the ECF platform for funding rather than traditional funding institutions. This study aims to investigate the performance of ECF-funded firms in Malaysia and provide empirical insights into this field. In summary, financial management is a critical aspect of the managerial process that has garnered interest from both the government and academia.","International Journal of Scientific and Management Research, (2022); Afrifa, Godfred A., Working capital management and performance of listed SMEs, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 27, 6, pp. 557-578, (2014); Geography of Crowdfunding, (2011); Ahmad, Noor Hazlina, Entrepreneurial competencies and firm performance in emerging economies: A study of women entrepreneurs in malaysia, Contributions to Management Science, pp. 5-26, (2018); Journal of Chinese Entrepreneurship, (2012); Abdallah Alalwan, Ali Abdallah, Entrepreneurial e-equity crowdfunding platforms: antecedents of knowledge acquisition and innovation performance, European Journal of Innovation Management, 27, 2, pp. 521-550, (2024); International Journal of Scientific Technology Research, (2021); Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management, (2017); AlQershi, Nagwan Abdulwahab, The influence of structural capital on the relationship between CRM implementation and the performance of manufacturing SMEs, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 13, 3, pp. 1205-1218, (2022); Anane, Stephen, The characteristics and impact of small and medium forest enterprises on sustainable forest management in Ghana, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023)","","Universiti Malaysia Terengganu","","","","","","26727226; 18238556","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211039547"

A total of 258 individuals in Malaysia were asked to complete a questionnaire to gather statistics. To assess the research model and test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling with partial least squares (SEM-PLS) was utilized. Smart PLS path analysis results revealed that perceived convenience, perceived security, perceived cost social influence, and innovativeness were positively significant determinants of digital payment adoption. This study offers fresh theoretical perspectives for identifying potential adoption barriers that need to be addressed. Concerns about privacy and security, a lack of information or comprehension, and aversion to change are all prevalent challenges among Millennials. Recognizing these limitations allows service providers to incorporate measures such as better security features, educational campaigns, and user-friendly interfaces to alleviate these concerns and boost adoption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital payment; Generation Z; innovativeness; mobile payment; perceived convenience; perceived cost; social influence","","","","","Journal of Education Al Mejlh Altrbwyh, (2023); American Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, (2017); Alochana Chakra Journal, (2020); Arab Journal of Administrative Sciences, (2023); Journal of Education Al Mejlh Altrbwyh, (2024); Al-Gasaymeh, Anwar S., Dynamic Model in Estimating the Impact of Competition on Banking Efficiency: Evidence form MENA Countries, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 193, pp. 385-394, (2023); Alghamdi, Hanan M., Unveiling Sentiments: A Comprehensive Analysis of Arabic Hajj-Related Tweets from 2017–2022 Utilizing Advanced AI Models, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 8, 1, (2024); Alghusin, Nawaf Salem, The impact of financial policy on economic growth in Jordan (2000-2017): An ardl approach, Ekonomski Pregled, 71, pp. 97-108, (2020); Alhaimer, Rashed Salem, Digital transformation on the design and implementation of virtual political campaigns in Kuwait: perceptions and attitudes of politicians and campaign managers for bold innovation and social impact in Kuwait, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, (2024); Alhawamdeh, Loai Naser, Do E-Service Quality and Digital Content Moderate the Relationship between Website Design and the Intention to visit the Museum?, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 194, pp. 143-150, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210601131"

This study aims to investigate the impact of RMPs on FP through the mediating effect of DT. To analyze the linkage between these constructs, we created an index for RMPs, five unique proxies (mobile [MB_DEA], big data [BD_DEA], Internet of Things [IoT], cloud computing [CC_DEA], and social media [SM_DEA]) of DT, and Tobin's Q as a proxy of FP and operationalized the theory of contingency. The data between 2009 and 2020 was collected from Indonesian and Malaysian IBs and was analyzed using the two-step generalized method of moments (GMMs) technique. The empirical findings represent that RMPs and DT have a significant positive effect on FP. Simultaneously, RMPs have a significant positive effect on two proxies of DT (MB_DEA and SM_DEA), and an insignificant positive effect on the remaining three proxies of DT (BD_DEA, IoT_DEA, and CC_DEA). Simultaneously, DT as a mediator plays a significant role between RMPs and FP. This study contributes to systematizing the RMPs of IBs by integrating digitalization which eventually will increase the financial portfolios of IBs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital risk management; digitalization; financial performance; Islamic banks; risk management practices","","","","Funding: This study was supported by the Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM).

The study utilized a structured questionnaire to evaluate 231 students’ understanding and familiarity with fintech concepts, focusing on demographic factors and perceived curriculum gaps. The study’s participants were diverse in gender, age, institution, major, and year of study. The majority were male (63%), with 78% aged between 20 and 25. The study reveals that students’ familiarity and understanding of fintech concepts like blockchain, smart contracts, neo-banking, crowdfunding, cloud computing, big data analytics, robo-advisors, and AI are low. This highlights significant gaps in students’ knowledge of critical areas digital finance, e-payments or e-banking. The study shows a moderate correlation between demographic factors and students’ fintech awareness, with 13.9% of variation explained by these factors. The overall model is statistically significant (F = 7.265, P < 0.001), indicating that these factors collectively impact students’ knowledge and awareness of fintech. Gender, age, and university attended do not significantly influence fintech awareness, suggesting they are not major determinants. However, the study reveals that students’ awareness of fintech increases as they progress through their academic years, with certain majors showing higher levels of awareness. The study recommends universities incorporate fintech topics into their courses, develop accessible options, invest in resources, collaborate with fintech companies, strengthen industry partnerships, and offer cross-disciplinary electives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Awareness; Digitalization; Financial Services; Fintech; Internet of Things; Somalia","","","","","Journal of Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation, (2023); Al-Fuqaha, Ala Isam, Internet of Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 17, 4, pp. 2347-2376, (2015); Islamic Banking and Finance Review, (2018); International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, (2021); Alshraifa, Husain, FinTech Education: An Exploratory Study from the Point View of Business Students, Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, 503, pp. 153-169, (2024); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Asian Journal of Economics Business and Accounting, (2022); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Dasilas, Apostolos, The impact of FinTech firms on bank performance: evidence from the UK, EuroMed Journal of Business, 20, 1, pp. 244-258, (2025); Fintech in Germany, (2017)","","Econjournals","","","","","","21464138","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208743237"

Design/methodology/approach: Data gathered across RE firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were employed to test the model. The measurement model and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to test the items and the hypotheses illustrated in the proposed model. Findings: Perceived financial benefits, competitive pressure and top manager support were demonstrated to successfully influence blockchain adoption (BA). Despite blockchain’s early stages of development, its impact on RE operations cannot be ignored and should be more objectively examined in order to gain a better understanding of it. UAE blockchain-based companies could be seen as having a competitive advantage that maximizes resource consumption. Originality/value: This study introduces the positive influence of blockchain technology on RE payment transactions and may advance information on how blockchain technology has the potential to change the RE sector.

Based on a panel dataset of 2785 observations (220 banks) from 16 Sub-Saharan Africa countries between 2007 and 2022, we observe that bank sustainability reporting framework (BSRF) and board sustainability committee (BSCOM) are positively related to increased levels of BCCIs. Second, the study shows that the BSRF-BCCIs and BSCOM-BCCIs associations are positively moderated by CORPGOVDISCIN, indicating that these relationships are contingent on the quality of the bank's corporate governance mechanisms. Third, the study then provides evidence that BSCOM is positively related to FP, but BSRF has no effect on FP. Fourth, we also observe that BCCIs disclosure has positive impact on FP, but actual BCCIs investments do not seem to improve FP. Fifth, the study detects that the association between BCCIs and FP is significantly moderated by CG mechanisms. We identify CG disclosure as the possible channel through which BCCIs and FP are interlinked. Finally, we show that the predicted relationships vary across banks' operating periods.

This study aims to examine the characteristics of banks in Indonesia that influence lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises by adopting agency theory that explains the relationship between lenders (banks) and borrowers (MSMEs) as agents and principals. Data were taken from quarterly financial reports of banks in Indonesia. There are 42 sample banks from 2010 to 2022, so the data used are 2,182 observations. Data analysis uses a fixed effect model with robust standard errors. The results show that operating costs do not influence credit access for MSMEs or medium-sized enterprises. Bank stability has an impact on increasing MSME credit access. High bank capital also increases MSME credit access. Robustness tests were also conducted using the general method of moments. The results were consistent with the main model. The implication is that cost management theory and credit decision-making need to consider differences in business scale. The results also further strengthen the argument that bank stability is an important factor that can improve access to credit for small and medium enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bank capital; bank cost; bank stability; financial inclusion; lending; MSMEs","","","","Appreciation is given to the Doctoral program Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta Indonesia and the Institute of Research and Community Services (LPPM) Unisnu Jepara Indonesia, which has supported this research.","Abbas, Faisal, The impact of bank capital, bank liquidity and credit risk on profitability in postcrisis period:‎ A comparative study of US and Asia, Cogent Economics and Finance, 7, 1, (2019); Adhikary, Bishnu Kumar, Does the government credit guarantee promote micro, small, and medium enterprises?

Employing a normative legal approach and a descriptive-analytical method, the research examines legal principles and facts concerning cryptocurrency regulation in Indonesia. The findings reveal that, despite the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, their usage remains contentious from both regulatory and Islamic law perspectives. In Islamic law, cryptocurrency transactions are classified as haram lighairihi due to uncertainty (gharar) and speculative risks, making them non-compliant with Sharia principles. As a solution, this study proposes a framework for integrating cryptocurrency exchanges with Rupiah transactions using Sharia economic principles. This integration aims to mitigate risks while maintaining the flexibility of digital transactions, ensuring they align with regulatory standards and Islamic legal frameworks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Islamic law; rupiah exchange; sharia economic law","","","","","Abbas, Ilham, Utilitarianism Perspective on The Use of E-Stamps in Business Practices in Indonesia, Jurnal IUS Kajian Hukum dan Keadilan, 12, 1, pp. 224-236, (2024); Akbar, M.

The findings reveal that both service quality and product attributes significantly influence customer satisfaction, with service quality demonstrating a stronger correlation. Notably, aspects such as employee friendliness, responsiveness, and product diversity emerged as critical factors. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the importance of service quality in enhancing customer satisfaction specifically in the Islamic banking sector, an area that has received limited attention. The implications of this study are twofold: first, it offers valuable insights for Islamic banking institutions to refine their service delivery and product offerings, thereby fostering greater customer loyalty. Second, it highlights the need for continuous assessment of customer expectations and satisfaction metrics to ensure sustainable growth in the competitive financial landscape.

It has not remained merely a subject or object of the contract, whether as a material or moral product. However, it has progressed to play a fundamental and effective role in concluding contracts as an electronic agent. This agent enables the automation of contracts, either wholly or partially, without human intervention. The UAE legislator has shown keen interest in regulating this usage, initially through the Electronic Transactions Law of 2006, then the updated law of 2021, and most recently through the Trade through Modern Technology Law of 2023. This framework considers artificial intelligence an information program that represents the original principal and bears the consequences of the transaction it engages in, despite the absence of legal personality for the electronic agent. The integration of artificial intelligence and modern technologies has profoundly transformed the landscape of commercial law. AI technologies, including natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, are increasingly employed in contract formation, risk assessment, and dispute resolution. These tools enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and streamline transactional processes, benefiting both businesses and consumers. Furthermore, the rise of modern tools such as digital currencies, smart contracts, and blockchain has revolutionized commercial transactions by offering unprecedented levels of transparency, security, and automation. Blockchain ensures immutable and verifiable records, while smart contracts self-execute upon fulfillment of predetermined conditions, reducing reliance on intermediaries and reinforcing transactional integrity. This paper also explores the legal and regulatory responses to these developments. Jurisdictions globally are facing the need to revise existing laws or draft new ones to address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence and emerging commercial technologies. The evolving nature of technology calls for flexible and adaptive legal frameworks to ensure that commercial law remains relevant and effective. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; automated contract; electronic intermediary; regular agent; trade with modern technology","","","","","Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023); Kurdish Studies, (2024); Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, AMELIORATING PUBLIC PROCUREMENT PERFORMANCE: GREEN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT POLICIES WITHIN A LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK, Corporate Law and Governance Review, 7, 2, pp. 21-31, (2025); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE SETTLEMENT OF STATE CONTRACT DISPUTES, Corporate Law and Governance Review, 6, 3, pp. 122-134, (2024); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, Supreme Constitutional Court review of the legislative omission in Egypt in light of international experiences, Heliyon, 10, 17, (2024); Journal of Lifestyle and Sdgs Review, (2025); Choice of Law in Respect of Agency Relationships in the European Union and the United Arab Emirates, (2015); Digital Evidence and Electronic Signature Law Review, (2025); Allouzi, Adel Salem, Adequate legal rules in settling metaverse disputes: Hybrid legal framework for metaverse dispute resolution (HLFMDR), International Journal of Data and Network Science, 7, 4, pp. 1627-1642, (2023)","","Royallite Global","","","","","","27085945; 27085953","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012734005"

Whilst this type of technology is seen as a step forward in terms of traceability, transparency and immutability to increase digital resilience, we argue that it should be approached with trepidation. Design/methodology/approach: In developing this paper, the authors conduct a systematic literature search using the Scopus database. Through this, we identified 931 relevant articles, of which 30 were used as the focus of this article. Thematic analysis was used as the analytical approach to develop themes and meaning from the data. Findings: In this paper, there is an emphasis on the importance of understanding the potential risks associated with SC implementation, as well as identifying appropriate strategies for mitigating any negative impact. In our findings, we puts forward three key themes, namely legality, security and human error, which we argue are key smart contract challenges that impact SME digital resilience. Originality/value: In this paper, we propose the notion of “centralised control in decentralised solutions”. This comes from the research highlighting SC weaknesses in digital resilience for SMEs. We argue that there is a need for standards, regulations and legislation to address these issues, advocating, ironically, a centralised approach to decentralised technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Digital resilience; International entrepreneurship; Smart contracts; SMEs","","","","","Kumar Agrawal, Tarun Kumar, Blockchain-based framework for supply chain traceability: A case example of textile and clothing industry, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 154, (2021); Kumar Agrawal, Tarun Kumar, Demonstration of a blockchain-based framework using smart contracts for supply chain collaboration, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 5, pp. 1497-1516, (2023); Albizri, Abdullah, Trust but verify: The oracle paradox of blockchain smart contracts, Journal of Information Systems, 35, 2, pp. 1-16, (2021); Alexander, Carol O., Price discovery and microstructure in ether spot and derivative markets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 71, (2020); Mastering Ethereum Building Smart Contracts and Dapps, (2018); Arslan, Ahmad, Artificial intelligence and human workers interaction at team level: a conceptual assessment of the challenges and potential HRM strategies, International Journal of Manpower, 43, 1, pp. 75-88, (2022); Asadi, Mandana, The appropriation of blockchain implementation in the supply chain of SMES based on fuzzy LMAW, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 123, (2023); Asante Boakye, Elijah, Seizing technological advancement; determinants of blockchain supply chain finance adoption in Ghanaian SMEs, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 36, 10, pp. 2774-2790, (2024); Asante, Mary, Distributed Ledger Technologies in Supply Chain Security Management: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 2, pp. 713-739, (2023); Badi, Sulafa M., Technological, organisational and environmental determinants of smart contracts adoption: UK construction sector viewpoint, Construction Management and Economics, 39, 1, pp. 36-54, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17410398","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186439930"

This research used quantitative methods involving 750 respondents Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) administrators as Zakat payers throughout Indonesia consisting of 552 districts. NU, the largest community in Indonesia, faces low Zakat capability. This research proposes a new concept, combining Social Identity Theory, Resource Advantage Theory, and the origin of NU values, 'Mabaadi Khaira Ummah', to revive the principles towards the best generation and build NRV as novelty. This research identifies four variables that influence the trust of Zakat payers: NRV, GCG elements (accountability-AC, transparency-TR, and credibility-CR). The findings show that AC and TR do not have a real impact to ZPT as they are only significant at the 10% level, but not significant at the 5% level. CR does not affect ZPT. However, the three variables (AC, TR, and CR) affect ZPT if mediated by NRV, which has significant effect on ZPT. Additionally, the results indicate that NRV acts as full mediation, meaning AC, TR, and CR affect ZPT only through NRV. The new concept of NRV is powerful, fills the theoretical gap and offers a new perspective on religious values in the theory of resource superiority and social identity theory as applied in certain religious fields such as Zakat, as an obligation in Islam. NRV addresses relationships between variables and contributes to the development of trust in Zakat. In addition, NRV can be used to trigger the NU community to increase the volume of Zakat. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","GCG; Nahdlatul Ulama; Nahdliyah Religious Value; Trust; Zakat Payer","","","","","International Journal of Academic Research in Economics and Management Sciences, (2021); Agndal, Henrik, Trust, distrust, and open-book accounting in three client-vendor relationships, Contemporary Accounting Research, 41, 1, pp. 292-323, (2024); Orasi Jurnal Dakwah Dan Komunikasi, (2021); International Journal of Zakat, (2019); Tarbiya Islamia Jurnal Pendidikan Dan Keislaman, (2019); Jurnal Ekonomi and Keuangan Islam, (2020); Bargoni, Augusto, Growth hacking and international dynamic marketing capabilities: a conceptual framework and research propositions, International Marketing Review, 41, 1, pp. 74-106, (2024); Psychology of Trust, (2021); Becker, Annika, In Nonprofits We Trust?

Successful integration of asset transfers across diverse DeFi platforms hinges on effective interoperability and transaction finality, ensuring security and cost efficiency. This paper introduces CrossDeFi, a novel cross-chain communication protocol tailored to address the challenges posed by heterogeneity in consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and token systems. CrossDeFi introduces two key mechanisms: Miner and bridge selection (MBS) and improved transfer confirmation (ITC). The MBS mechanism optimizes the selection of miners and bridges based on the unique characteristics of each blockchain, significantly improving transfer accuracy, cost efficiency, and speed. Meanwhile, the ITC mechanism leverages cryptographic primitives to secure asset transfer confirmations, ensuring robust transaction finality. The protocol’s effectiveness is demonstrated through detailed efficiency and security analyses, complemented by a prototype evaluation that showcases its capabilities in reducing transfer durations and costs. These findings underscore the potential of CrossDeFi to transform the DeFi ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain interoperability; cross-chain asset transfer; CrossDeFi protocol; DeFi (decentralized finance); finality guarantee in the blockchain; smart contract security","Blockchain; Block-chain; Blockchain interoperability; Communications protocols; Cross-chain asset transfer; Crossdefi protocol; Decentralised; Decentralized finance; Finality guarantee in the blockchain; Smart contract security","","","","Popchev, Ivan P., Oracles Integration in Blockchain-Based Platform for Smart Crop Production Data Exchange, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 10, (2023); Appl Comput Eng, (2023); Sathya, A.

Banks are not unaffected by this, as they face many future challenges and are thus directly affected by narratives. For this reason, this article aims to reveal the future prospects within the academic landscape on the basis of a scoping literature review to create transparency about where the narratives come from. So, it is not the intention to make another prediction about the future of the banks. The paper presents contributions that make explicit statements about the future of banks, either a description of the future or an assessment of the future prospects of banks. Two databases were searched in this context, IDEAS/RePEc and Scopus, for the period from 2001 to 2021. A total of 99 relevant contributions were identified and finally used to answer three questions: (1) What challenges are seen for banks in the future? (2) What kind of future is depicted? (3) How are the future prospects derived? It turns out that challenges are seen in profitability, regulation, technology, and customer behaviour. The future prospects vary considerably, which puts the focus on the last question. Among other things, an overemphasis on intermediation theory tends to generate negative future prospects. It can be seen that the importance of the assumptions for the derivation of future prospects has not yet been recognised and further research is necessary to get a more complete picture of the future of banks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banks; Future; Literature review; Narratives","","","","","Future of Banking, (2003); Alam, Nafis, Do Islamic banks shift from mark-up to equity financing when their contracting environments are improved?, Applied Economics Letters, 24, 8, pp. 545-548, (2017); Allen, Franklin, China's financial system: Growth and risk, Foundations and Trends in Finance, 9, 3-4, pp. 197-319, (2014); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arestis, Philip, Washington consensus and financial liberalization, Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, 27, 2, pp. 251-271, (2004); Financial Liberalization Beyond Orthodox Concerns, (2005); Ariff, Mohamed, Islamic banking in Malaysia: The changing landscape, Institutions and Economies, 9, 2, pp. 1-13, (2017); Arksey, Hilary, Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework, International Journal of Social Research Methodology: Theory and Practice, 8, 1, pp. 19-32, (2005); Monetary and Economic Studies, (2002); Forefront, (2013)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","21981639; 21981620","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149127530"

However, one of the significant challenges faced by the market is the transfer of ownership of ṣukūk assets to ṣukūk holders, mainly due to legal restrictions, particularly in sovereign ṣukūk issuance. The study explores the concept of ownership in Sharīʿah and discusses pertinent contemporary issues in the sale contract as a means of transferring ownership of sovereign sukuk assets. This research employs a qualitative doctrinal methodology to scrutinize literature pertaining to ownership through a Sharīʿah lens. The analysis centers on the attributes of ownership and methods of acquisition, while also delving into significant Shariah considerations surrounding the transfer of sovereign sukuk ownership, as well as divergent perspectives on terms within sales agreements. Deepening the Shariah perspective of ownership transfer for sustainable Sukuk issuance is the sine qua non for alignment between the Shariah and regulatory requirements. This study found that the clarity on the Shariah position of the ownership of Sukuk holders will ensures tradability, security, and protection of Sukuk holders, hence actualizing the sustainable Sukuk issuance in the Sukuk markets. These findings shed light on the challenges and considerations surrounding the transfer of ownership in the ṣukūk market, providing insights into the role of legal constraints and the importance of aligning transactions with Sharīʿah principles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ownership transfer; Shariah perspective; Sovereign Sukuk; Sukuk issuance","","","","The authors acknowledged the supports of INCEIF University and International Islamic University Malaysia in providing necessary materials in carrying out the research work.","Challenges of Profit and Loss Sharing Financing in Malaysian Islamic Banking, (2016); Abdul Razak, Lutfi, The concept and application of ḍamān al-milkiyyah (ownership risk): Islamic law of contract perspective, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 9, 2, pp. 148-163, (2017); Al Milkiyyah Wa Nazariyyat Al Aqdf Al Shar at Al Hlamiyyah, (2025); Shari Ah Standards, (2015); Al Milkiyyah Fi Al Shariah Al Islamiyyah Maa Al Muqaranah Bi Al Sharai Al Wadiyyah, (2025); A Critical Analysis of Special Purpose Vehicles in the Islamic Banking Industry the Kingdom of Bahrain as A Case Study, (2016); Quyd Al Milkiyyah Al Khah; Al Sail Al Jarar Al Mutadaffiq Ala Hadaiq Al Azhar, (2004); Paper Presented at the 9th International Shariah Scholars Forum, (2014); Al Hawi Al Qudusi Fi Furu Fiqh Al Hanafi, (2011)","","USIM Press","","","","","","22321047; 01278886","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005975677"

It was an applied research study using a descriptive and correlational design. All banks operate in the Arab world. We used screening procedures to select a sample of banks. The findings indicate the inclusion of board members with expertise in compliance, law, or finance has a favorable effect on financial institutions' AML initiatives. Board members who have experience in the financial sector or who have specific knowledge of anti-money laundering laws improve the results of anti-money laundering efforts, thereby avoiding fines for their companies. The Board of Director’s knowledge of anti-money laundering legislation, its ability to ensure the bank’s adherence to national and international anti-money laundering laws, and its flexibility in responding to regulatory modifications positively impact the commitment to anti-money laundering. The Board of Directors is the controller of the institution and therefore has the main role in combating money laundering.

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach has been used consisting of 62 completed surveys with closed-ended and open-ended questions, follow-up comments and five in-depth interviews with hoteliers in the mid-Sweden region. Content analysis has been employed. Findings: Three categories of meanings are the main findings: general perception, safeguarding Swedish secular values and financially unjustifiable have been discovered. Most of the respondents have been sceptical towards halal and Muslim-friendly hotel concepts due to financial and cultural challenges these two concepts have for the Swedish tourism and hotel industries. Based on the SET, this entails more costs than benefits and is especially at odds with Swedish-rooted secular values. Practical implications: This study provides practical implications and increased knowledge for tourism stakeholders including hotels in Sweden.

Whereas ethics is based on the moral and religious understanding of good and evil, adherence to religious norms is vital for many nations. In Islam, privacy is a fundamental value that is deeply rooted in the principles of Shariah law and focuses on the dignity of the individual, personal boundaries and moral behaviour. Therefore, the use of AI technologies by Islamic nations raises concerns about the compatibility of these traditional privacy norms with ethical frameworks for AI. To ensure that the field of AI is not only innovative but also morally and religiously acceptable, an optimal balance between ethical governance and technological advancement must be maintained. This study examines the approaches of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in integrating Islamic ethics and privacy rules into their ethical frameworks for AI. The study utilised qualitative methods, including descriptive and content analyses, combined with a comparative approach from data collected through documentary method. The transition from Islamic ethics to digital Islamic ethics experienced the significant influence of Islamic business ethics, which places a strong emphasis on justice, accountability and human dignity. Future studies on digital Islamic ethics need to follow the pace of technological advancement and identify the future ethical risks and gaps. The Islamic concept of privacy is unique. It differs from the Western legal approach in that it emphasises the importance of adherence to Shariah teachings and provides a strict and clear explanation for desirable behaviour in doubtful and ambiguous cases. The digital age requires the evolution of the Islamic concept of privacy to address the ethical and legal challenges posed by technological advances. The ethical frameworks for AI adopted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates illustrate the integration of cultural and ethical values with technological innovation. The governments attach great importance to harmonising security and privacy with Islamic principles. Both countries demonstrate how universal ethical rules for AI can be adapted to national circumstances. A customised ethical framework will therefore not only promote innovation and technological progress, but also ensure that these are in line with national ethical standards, cultural and religious values and societal needs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; digital environment; ethics; Islam; Privacy","","","","","Abdallah, Salam, Islamic ethics: An exposition for resolving ICT ethical dilemmas, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, 8, 3, pp. 289-301, (2010); Abokhodair, Norah, Privacy & social media in the context of the Arab Gulf, pp. 672-683, (2016); Architecture and Behaviour Journal, (1996); Journal of Contemporary Administration and Management Adman, (2023); Ahmad, Ahmad Atif, Islam, modernity, violence, and everyday life, pp. 1-213, (2009); Right to Privacy in the Islamic Jurisprudence, (2018); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2025); Al Maqasid the International Journal of Maqasid Studies and Advanced Islamic Research, (2024); Zaid, Bouziane, Digital Islam and Muslim Millennials: How Social Media Influencers Reimagine Religious Authority and Islamic Practices, Religions, 13, 4, (2022); International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, (2022)","","Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","","","","","","25904396; 19857454","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214283073"

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS was applied to data collected from 400 Islamic bank customers. The results indicate that service quality (estimate 0.253, C.R. 3.229) and transaction security (estimate 1.581, C.R. 3.216) have a significant impact on customer satisfaction. Product innovation also significantly affects customer satisfaction (estimate 0.723, C.R. 6.484) but does not significantly influence loyalty (estimate 0.130, C.R. 0.545, P 0.693). Conversely, customer satisfaction significantly affects loyalty (estimate 0.234, C.R. 2.534, P 0.027).

This paper aims to present features of Shariah-compliant security tokens and supporting ecosystems that can provide additional sources of financing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and create alternative investment opportunities for retail investors. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper presents the building blocks of security tokens, their ecosystem and key functions and activities and then examines these features from Islamic perspectives.

These scholars, selected through purposive and snowball sampling techniques, possess expert knowledge of both cryptocurrency and the Islamic financial system. The results revealed that the acceptability of cryptocurrency in Sharīʿah-compliant financial systems is contingent on its centralization and its function as a store of value, aligning with the objectives (maqasid) of Sharīʿah. Cryptocurrency's lack of intrinsic value necessitates its backing by a central authority or asset to mitigate risks and potential fraud.

Design/Methodology/Approach — The paper used an interview method to obtain information related to Islamic estate planning of crypto assets. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with informants of five different backgrounds including lawyers, estate planners, Sharīʿah experts, digital asset exchange (DAX) operators, and crypto owners. The data gathered was analysed using thematic analysis to construct the framework of Islamic estate planning of crypto assets. Findings — The paper identifies important prerequisites of Islamic estate planning of crypto assets. Further, a framework of estate planning of crypto assets is developed based on the information gathered from all related stakeholders. It is posited that the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has a vital role to play in safeguarding the financial interests of digital asset holders and their beneficiaries and that implementation of this framework would align with and uphold the objectives of Sharīʿah (maqāṣid al-Sharīʿah). Originality/Value — This paper presents a framework of Islamic estate planning of crypto assets, it being one of the first studies to do so from the Islamic perspective, which is not only useful and relevant for Malaysians (Muslims) but also for other countries. Research Limitations/Implications — The first limitation of the paper is that the framework is developed based on a qualitative method. There is no evidence of its validity, which is a gap that can be explored in the future. Second, it involves the perceptions of five types of respondents, which may be broadened to other related stakeholders such as regulators—i.e., Securities Commissions or any ministries—in future studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crypto asset; Digital asset; Intergenerational transfer; Islamic estate planning; Sharīʿah","","","","Our appreciation goes to the Ministry of Higher Education for the financial support of this study under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/SS01/UUM/02/9) and to Universiti Utara Malaysia for facilitating the management of the research.","Aziz, Ahmad Shamsul Abd, The Money of The Future: A Study of The Legal Challenges Facing Cryptocurrencies, BiLD Law Journal, 7, 1, pp. 21-33, (2022); Journal of Islam in Asia, (2020); New Breeze, (2020); Abd Wahab, Norazlina, Shariah Perspective on Crypto as Asset (Mal): Justifying the Needs of Estate Planning and Inheritance of Digital Asset, International Journal of Islamic Thought, 24, 1, pp. 157-167, (2023); Australian Taxation Office Ato Community, (2021); Cryptocurrency an Holistic and Contemporary Syariah Analysis Part V; Estate Planning Studies and Briefs, (2011); Spring Conference National College of Probate Judges, (2019); Schlun Elseven, (2023); Halal Cryptocurrency Management, (2019)","","International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA)","","","","","","22894365; 01281976","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200413888"

The objective is to analyse the challenges associated with incorporating cryptocurrencies into regulatory frameworks and to explore constraints in the regulatory institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. Design/methodology/approach: The study methodology consists of two steps. The first step is to identify regulatory constraints in the literature review and in the next step, interviews are conducted with officials of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The study used a qualitative case study methodology, in which a single case (regulatory constraint) was selected as a unit of analysis. Findings: The findings show that lack of traceability, legal status, lack of governmental control due to decentralization, difficulty enforcing laws, volatility, lack of skills with regulators and difficulty integrating cryptocurrencies into the current financial system are the main obstacles to the introduction of a regulatory framework. Thus, on a broader conceptual level, the findings can be grouped into opportunism, lack of strategic capability and fragmented global laws. Research limitations/implications: This study could inform global cryptocurrency regulation discussions, sharing a developing country’s views on balancing the government, central banks, the financial sector and public interests. This could guide countries to consider cryptocurrency adoption in similar situations. This could affect the cryptocurrency market, impacting demand, supply and investor trust in Pakistan. Practical implications: The study has implications for policy making officials. The research aims to offer valuable insights to the SBP and other regulatory authorities, helping them identify potential risks and create an effective regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Social implications: The study has implications for society in knowing about the volatile nature of cryptos and anonymity of their issuers, which poses regulatory constraints. This then implies its harmfullness to its traders and the huge losses that may arise from their trading due to its volatile nature.

It is because the Zakat Management Organization and online platforms that facilitate zakat payments online still need legal certainty regarding collecting, using, and reporting personal data about zakat payers (muzakki). There needs to be more clarity on the types of muzakki's personal data that can be collected and reported by Zakat Management Organization and online platforms to the government, which creates the potential for a muzakki's personal data breach. This article uses normative legal research methods with statutory and conceptual approaches. In conclusion, a mutually agreed-upon personal data protection agreement is required between Zakat Management Organization, the online platform, and muzakki. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the zakat management law to be adaptive to personal data protection by amending Law Number 23 of 2011 concerning the Management of Zakat. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Legal Reform; Personal Data; Zakat","","","","","Narvaez Rojas, Carolina, Society 5.0: A Japanese concept for a superintelligent society, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 12, (2021); Problems and Perspectives in Management, (2020); undefined; Sait, Muhammad Azmi, Industrial Revolution 4.0: A New Challenge to Brunei Darussalam's Unemployment Issue, International Journal of Asian Business and Information Management, 12, 4, pp. 33-44, (2021); International Conference of Zakat, (2021); Outlook Zakat Indonesia 2022, (2021); Ács, Zoltán J., The evolution of the global digital platform economy: 1971–2021, Small Business Economics, 57, 4, pp. 1629-1659, (2021); Uin Raden Inten Lampung, (2020); Alam, Azhar, Generation Z perceptions in paying Zakat, Infaq, and Sadaqah using Fintech: A comparative study of Indonesia and Malaysia, Investment Management and Financial Innovations, 19, 2, pp. 320-330, (2022); Annur, (1995)","","Faculty of Sharia, Sultan Aji Muhammad Idris State Islamic University","","","","","","24606588; 18299067","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201417373"

This study delves into the semantics and ontology for developing a Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) profile in the context of Pakistan’s Land Administration Systems (LASs), which currently face issues due to manual record-keeping, lack of transparency, frauds, and disintegration. Establishing a baseline through Record of Rights (RoR) and Property Information Report (PIR), alongside surveying and mapping procedures defined by laws and rules, forms the foundation for LADM profile development. This study explores the transition from manual LAS to 2D/3D representation, using LADM as a conceptual guideline. The LADM profile’s three key packages—PK_Party, PK_Administrative, and PK_SpatialUnit—a sub-package, and external classes are examined, with proposals for digitalisation and modernisation. Additionally, the study includes expert consultation, and highlights the significant support that the LADM implementation offers to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Pakistan. In conclusion, the study underscores the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to address organisational overlaps and ambiguities within LAS, positioning PK LADM as a transformative force for sustainable urban LAS in Pakistan, aligning with broader SDGs. Recommendations include exploring realistic land valuation, integrated ownership and location verification systems, addressing historical survey data challenges, and promoting wider stakeholder adoption for sustainable 2D/3D urban LAS using LADM and its edition II as a way forward towards the creation of a smart city and digital twin. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D LAS; LADM; land administration; land tenure; real estate; SDGs; urban planning","cadastre; land management; land market; land tenure; Sustainable Development Goal; urban planning; Pakistan","","","Authors acknowledge the expert consultation support from the following participants, including Khubaib Abuzar and Rana M.

Traditional governance structures often grapple with inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and security issues in estate management. This paper comprehensively explores the impact of blockchain on estate governance, and then risk management and business sustainability. This research centers on the role of risk management on business sustainability to mediate and moderate the effect of estate governance on business sustainability. The results indicate that effective real estate governance positively affects risk management practices in real estate. However, both real estate governance and risk management contribute to business sustainability. Moreover, there are still gaps in the literature that require further investigation. Where policymakers and practitioners can develop informed strategies to strengthen governance structures, mitigate risks, and promote sustainable practices in real estate; Thus, pro-moting long-term success and resilience in the real estate industry. It is worth noting that future research should focus on empirical testing of the proposed hypotheses to provide a better understanding of these dynamics and their implications for risk management that can affect business sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Business Sustainability and Technology; Estate Governance; Governance; Risk Management","","","","","Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2020); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2023); Alrefai, Nashat, An integrated framework based deep learning for cancer classification using microarray datasets, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 14, 3, pp. 2249-2260, (2023); Alshehadeh, Abdul Razzak, Financial Technology as a Basis for Financial Inclusion and its Impact on Profitability: Evidence from Commercial Banks, International Journal of Advances in Soft Computing and its Applications, 14, 2, pp. 125-138, (2022); Al-Taani, Attallah Hassan Mohamed, Exploring the impact of digital accounting and digital zakat on improving business sustainability in the Middle East and Malaysia, International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 11, 1, pp. 56-67, (2024); Bailis, Peter D., Research for practice: Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and smart contracts; Hardware for deep learning, Communications of the ACM, 60, 5, pp. 48-51, (2017); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2023); Casino, Fran, A systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications: Current status, classification and open issues, Telematics and Informatics, 36, pp. 55-81, (2019); Reviewing the Smartpls 4 Software the Latest Features and Enhancements, (2024)","","Growing Science","","","","","","25618156; 25618148","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192693937"

With a primary focus on bolstering sustainable agricultural value chains (SAVC), this conceptual paper investigates the transformative potential of Financial Technology (FinTech) solutions. The study synthesizes insights from prior research on SAVC, hurdles faced by smallholder farmers, conventional strategies, and the untapped prospects offered by FinTech solutions in the agricultural sector. Utilizing the PRISMA strategy for comprehensive documentation retrieval, the study underscores the significance of creating a robust SAVC to empower smallholder farmers within the broader value chain landscape. It is found that Agri-FinTech solutions represent a pivotal avenue for advancing living standards and cultivating agricultural sustainability in developing nations. The integration of FinTech solutions for agri-credit mechanisms and product market facilitation catalyzes enabling pre-production financing and ensures fair prices for smallholder farmers in the post-production phase while neutralizing the value chain's exploitation potential. The study advocates for the expeditious adoption of information technology in developing countries, spotlighting the transformative role of Mobile Financial Services (MFS), which fortifies the agriculture sector, ensuring its resilience and responsiveness to the evolving demands of a globalized market. Drawing upon an evaluation of existing literature on FinTech-enhanced agricultural initiatives in developing nations, the study outlines directions for future research and creates a path for a more nuanced understanding of the strategic enhancements necessary to fortify the SAVC, fostering a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for smallholder farmers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agri-credit mechanism; agricultural value chain financing; FinTech; mobile financial services; smallholder farmers; sustainable agricultural value chains","","","","This research was supported by 10 Minute School, Dhaka, Bangladesh, under grant number 6419576.","Abid, Ali, Application of structural equation modelling to develop a conceptual model for smallholder's credit access: The mediation of agility and innovativeness in organic food value chain finance, PLOS ONE, 15, 8 August, (2020); Empowering Indonesia S Women Farmers, (2020); Agyekumhene, Christopher, Digital platforms for smallholder credit access: The mediation of trust for cooperation in maize value chain financing, NJAS - Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences, 86-87, pp. 77-88, (2018); Proper Policy is Needed for Ensuring Fair Paddy Price, (2019); Aker, Jenny C., Mobile phones and economic development in Africa, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24, 3, pp. 207-232, (2010); Akinwale, Yusuf Opeyemi, Factors influencing attitudes and intention to adopt financial technology services among the end-users in Lagos State, Nigeria, African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development, 14, 1, pp. 272-279, (2022); Government Procurement of Rice Through App Delayed Limited, (2020); Sustainable Agricultural Value Chain, (2022); Anshari, Muhammad, Customer relationship management and big data enabled: Personalization & customization of services, Applied Computing and Informatics, 15, 2, pp. 94-101, (2019); Anshari, Muhammad, Digital marketplace and FinTech to support agriculture sustainability, Energy Procedia, 156, pp. 234-238, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","25723170","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190407021"

The study used non-probability convenience and snowballing sampling approaches to collect data. The study collects a sample of 210 respondents targeting bankers in various positions from the Indian commercial banks. The study used structural equation modeling to estimate the results. The findings highlight the complex links between IT governance, FinTech, and sustainability-related concerns, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustainability. Banks can establish more complete strategies for sustainable growth by considering IT governance, FinTech, and ESG factors. The findings reveal that IT governance is critical in shaping banks’ strategic planning towards sustainable activities, evolution of Fintech, and technological advancements, which in turn influence significantly and positively sustainability performance. IT governance leads to increased adoption of Fintech and enhances sustainability performance, contributing to the growth of economic sustainability. Banks that strategically utilize IT governance to foster Fintech and sustainability performance improvements likely experience economic gains due to their focus on sustainable and technologically driven practices. The findings emphasize the importance of balancing sustainability efforts and suggest that banks that embrace IT governance while emphasizing ESG factors are more likely to embrace better sustainability performance.

Therefore, this research investigates the determinants of digital-only banks' perceived value and its mediating role on the relationship between behavioural intention determinants and the intention to adopt digital-only banks. The data was collected through an online survey conducted among Klang Valley residents. Stratified random sampling was used to gather the data and structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied for the data analysis. The findings revealed that perceived value is a significant predictor of the intention to adopt digital-only banks. Furthermore, perceived convenience, economic efficiency, functional risk, trust, and environmental concern determined the perceived value of digital-only banks. However, security risk, critical mass, and number of services were non-significant predictors of perceived value. Notably, perceived value plays a significant mediating role between certain determinants and adoption intention. This research adds value by revealing multifaceted determinants of perceived value and incorporating environmental concern that highlights the significance of green perceived value in shaping adoption intention. Furthermore, it provides empirical results on a research gap related to digital-only banks' perceived value mediating effect on the intention to adopt these banks.

Results also indicate that investors show greater technopian views on AI, higher AI awareness, and higher third-level AI equality than non-investors. Furthermore, the mediation effect of trust in cryptocurrencies on the relationship between investment status and perceived asset value of NFTs and the moderation effect of AI awareness on the relationship between investment status and third-level AI equality were revealed.

In this context, the present study aims to formulate a model for Ph.D. supervisor selection from the offered alternatives in an academic institute. A hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework has been applied to select the suitable supervisor of the student's preferred criteria under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) scenario. The IVIF Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to prioritize the criteria, whereas IVIF Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) technique is engaged to rank the available supervisors based on criteria weight. A set of eight criteria and five alternatives have been considered for modeling the problem. Moreover, the potential criteria are weighted and ranked by the multiple decision makers in the present study. To examine the consistency and robustness of the proposed integrated approach, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis have been carried out. From all the analyses, it can be conferred that the suggested approach is quite useful to apply in different decision-making scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AHP; Interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy number; PhD supervisor selection; Research institute; TOPSIS","","","","","How to Get A Phd A Handbook for Students and their Supervisors, (2000); Hasan, Mir Anamul, A multi-criteria decision support system for Ph.D. Supervisor selection: A hybrid approach, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2019-January, pp. 1823-1832, (2019); International Journal of Doctoral Studies, (2007); Ives, Glenice, Supervisor selection or allocation and continuity of supervision: Ph.D. students' progress and outcomes, Studies in Higher Education, 30, 5, pp. 535-555, (2005); International Journal of Vocational and Technical Education, (2009); Journal of Management and Strategy, (2011); Interdisciplinary Management Research, (2014); van Rooij, Els Cornelia Maria, Factors that influence PhD candidates’ success: the importance of PhD project characteristics, Studies in Continuing Education, 43, 1, pp. 48-67, (2021); Jabre, Loay J., Ten simple rules for choosing a PhD supervisor, PLOS Computational Biology, 17, 9, (2021); Cardilini, Adam P.A., Supervising the PhD: identifying common mismatches in expectations between candidate and supervisor to improve research training outcomes, Higher Education Research and Development, 41, 3, pp. 613-627, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26667207","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187361438"

Understanding the factors that influence Muslim consumers’ purchasing behaviour is crucial to accelerate the growth in the family takaful market segment. However, research has yet to adequately address the drivers of family takaful purchase behaviour. By integrating religious obligation into the theory of planned behaviour, this study proposed and tested a model of the factors underlying family takaful purchasing behaviour, and further examined the moderating impact of gender. The findings show that Muslim consumers’ intentions to purchase family takaful are influenced by attitude and subjective norm, and purchasing behaviour is influenced by intention and perceived behavioural control. Although religious obligation affects attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control, its influence on family takaful purchasing intention and purchasing behaviour is not supported. These findings differ across male and female groups, emphasising the centrality of gender as a moderator and a boundary condition in the relationships posited in the model. The findings have various theoretical and managerial implications which are highlighted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Family takaful; Intention to purchase; Purchasing behaviour; Religious obligation; Theory of planned behaviour","","","","Open access funding provided by University of Johannesburg.

To compete with conventional banks, Shariah banks have accommodated financial technology (Fintech) and digitalisation to retain existing customers and attract potential customers. Furthermore, this study aims to analyse the role of organisational trust and commitment in mediating the effect of perceived organisational support and managers’ perceptions of the readiness for Shariah-compliant Fintech adoption. Design/methodology/approach: To obtain information, 115 managers from Shariah bank in Indonesia were surveyed. The data were then analysed using PLS-SEM with SmartPLS software. Findings: Perceived organisational support became crucial in improving readiness to adopt the digitalisation initiative and adhere to Shariah norms. Moreover, organisational trust and commitment fully mediated the effect of perceived organisational support and manager’s readiness to change towards Shariah digital bank. Practical implications: Adopting Fintech and its services can offer better value to customers. Digital technology has supported the merger acquisition of Shariah bank to reduce operational costs and improve productivity and service quality. The Fintech adoption in Shariah banks needs to align with a marketing strategy that can add value, offer efficient services and ensure that all transactions are safe, transparent and Riba-free (interest charged on financial transactions). Originality/value: From Shariah bank’s perspective, the role of organisational support in Fintech adoption is limited, and there is a lack of studies investigating managers’ readiness to change in post-merger and acquisitions. This study sheds new light on how Shariah banks must offer Fintech services and adopt digital technology to remain relevant and competitive. This study provides evidence of Shariah-compliant bank readiness and organisational support and commitment enablers using two mediating mechanisms. Properly adopting Fintech can provide superior service and Shariah-compliant banking services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank services; Commitment; Digital banking; Fintech; Readiness to change; Shariah compliance; Trust","","","","This research was funded by a grant from the Faculty of Economics and Business, Brawijaya University, Indonesia (Contract number: 20230704151431).

Has the digital economy truly realized this ideal? To answer this query, this paper delves into the correlation between the digital economy, resource mismatch, and urban housing costs across 272 Chinese cities. It evaluates the impact of policies propelled by the digital economy, using the “Broadband China” strategy as a benchmark. The findings suggest several key conclusions: (i) The imbalance in land resources exacerbates the digital economy's impact on escalating urban housing expenses. This effect is particularly pronounced in cities within the Yangtze River Economic Zone, cities experiencing low economic growth rates, large cities with high employment levels, and cities with relatively low wages. (ii) The rise of the digital economy has contributed to increased urban housing costs. For every 0.1 unit increase in a city's digital economy level, there is an observed average rise of 9.87% in housing costs. (iii) Policies steered by the digital economy, such as the “Broadband China” strategy, have significantly increased urban housing costs. A higher degree of resource mismatch correlates with a more pronounced impact of the “Broadband China” strategy pilot in elevating urban housing expenses. It is imperative to emphasize the qualitative ramifications of the digital economy. This should coincide with efforts to enhance resource utilization efficiency, aiming to mitigate the adverse effects of the digital economy's advancement on housing costs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China broadband strategy; Digital economy; Housing costs; Land resource mismatch","Costs; Economic and social effects; Natural resources; Query processing; China broadband strategy; Chinese cities; Digital economy; Economic growth rate; Economic zones; Housing cost; Land resource mismatch; Land resources; Urban housing; Yangtze River; Housing; correlation; cost analysis; digitization; governance approach; policy approach; urban economy; urban housing; China","","","Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Universities in Anhui Province\uFF082023AH050224\uFF09","Balemi, Nadia, COVID-19’s impact on real estate markets: review and outlook, Financial Markets and Portfolio Management, 35, 4, pp. 495-513, (2021); Balouchi, Mohammad, Reworks causes and related costs in construction: case of Parand mass housing project in Iran, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 36, 8, pp. 1392-1408, (2019); Beck, Thorsten, Big bad banks?

This sector plays a role in economic growth in both developed and developing nations, which in turn contributes to the nation's overall social and economic well-being. The goal of sustainable mineral management is to achieve a balance between the need to reduce harmful effects on ecosystems and communities and the economic benefits of mineral resources. The integration of Financial Technology (FinTech) into organizations' workflow has gained attention in the field of sustainability and environmental protection. In order to acquire the requisite knowledge for informing strategic planning, decision-making processes, and strategy development, a comprehensive review of pertinent literature is imperative. This study aims to address this issue by conducting a thematic analysis of the literature in the context of sustainability and Fintech. Following that, an in-depth Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis of FinTech in sustainable mineral management is deployed. The study investigates FinTech's integration into sustainable mineral management to advance responsible resource extraction practices and sheds light on effective FinTech utilization while highlighting implementation challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FinTech; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Sustainable mineral management; SWOT analysis; Thematic analysis","Decision making; Economics; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Mineral resources; Mining; Sustainable development; Comprehensive strength; Financial technology; Management IS; Mining sector; Strength analysis; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable mineral management; Sustainable resources managements; Thematic analysis; Threats analysis; Minerals; decision making; developing world; economic growth; mineral resource; mining industry; resource management; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal","","","The SDGs and the Paris Agreement represent essential milestones in the continuous global endeavor to create a climate-neutral economy and a sustainable society. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, an urgent call for action by all developed and developing countries in a global partnership. The 2030 Agenda and its Goals offer a comprehensive vision for sustainable development that relies on approaches such as scientific research and innovation, sustainable financing, and monitoring and evaluation. For this transformation to be successful, it is crucial to establish a new technological framework, enhance capacity-building efforts, and encourage a shift in consumption patterns. These ambitious goals require establishing these components (Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2023). Additionally, an essential aspect that has garnered considerable interest is the mobilization of financial resources. Securing the necessary funding has become a paramount focus to facilitate and support this transition towards sustainability. Numerous initiatives have been launched, most of which have been led by individuals or organizations affiliated with the United Nations (UN), to secure funding for the seventeen SDGs. These initiatives have the objective of establishing fundamental principles that will serve as a guide for the allocation of resources that are essential to the accomplishment of these goals (Migliorelli, 2021). The overarching aim is to align global economic policies and financial systems with the 2030 Agenda. In this endeavor, a substantial annual gap in funding, estimated to range from USD 5 to 7 trillion worldwide until 2030, has been identified. Therefore, the concept of SDG finance has become more important as an innovative solution to fill the funding gap and achieve important sustainability goals (Migliorelli, 2021).","Acquisti, Alessandro, The economics of privacy, Journal of Economic Literature, 54, 2, pp. 442-492, (2016); Resour Process, (2011); Alkaraan, Fadi, Corporate transformation toward Industry 4.0 and financial performance: The influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG), Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 175, (2022); Actioning the Global Goals for Local Impact, (2020); Arslan, Ahmad, Sustainable entrepreneurship development in Oman: a multi-stakeholder qualitative study, International Journal of Organizational Analysis, 31, 8, pp. 35-59, (2023); Ashta, Arvind, How Can Fintech Companies Get Involved in the Environment?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 13, (2023); Bachmann, Nadine, The Contribution of Data-Driven Technologies in Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 5, (2022); Bag, Surajit, Understanding and predicting the determinants of blockchain technology adoption and SMEs' performance, International Journal of Logistics Management, 34, 6, pp. 1781-1807, (2023); Baid, Vaishali, Amplifying and promoting the “S” in ESG investing: the case for social responsibility in supply chain financing, Managerial Finance, 48, 8, pp. 1279-1297, (2022); Beccarello, Massimo, Sustainable Development Goals Data-Driven Local Policy: Focus on SDG 11 and SDG 12, Administrative Sciences, 12, 4, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03014207","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191196299"

However, there is a current paucity of empirical research focusing specifically on the antecedents of blockchain adoption in the context of these countries. This study aims to investigate the behavioral intention (BI) to use blockchain by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, incorporating subjective and objective knowledge, trust in technology, and information literacy. The proposed structural model was assessed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using the data from 275 senior managers of Iranian poultry supply chains. The results showed that effort expectancy and performance expectancy were the most influential variables in predicting the BI to use blockchain technology, respectively. Furthermore, objective knowledge had an impact on the intention to use blockchain. However, subjective knowledge was not found to have any effect. The proposed model including the moderating effects of trust in technology and information literacy showed a higher predictive power. Trust in technology moderated the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention, and information literacy moderated the relationship between technical infrastructure, as one of the facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention.

The metaverse introduces a new economy in which users may earn real-world revenue through virtual activities, necessitating the need for efficient and dependable virtual asset accounting. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable record, appears to be a viable answer to these problems. This paper discusses the present status of blockchain technology for accounting for virtual assets in the metaverse as well as its potential role for businesses and the economy. It also determines the technology’s issues and limits and makes recommendations for further development. The approach of this study is based on a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the interactions between blockchain technology, virtual asset accounting, and the metaverse. The findings indicate that blockchain technology has the potential to transform virtual asset accounting in the metaverse by improving security, transparency, and consistency. However, scalability and legal/regulatory issues must be overcome before it can completely achieve its promise.

While crowdfunding has gained traction as an alternative funding source for businesses, it is unclear how far this concept can benefit a group of micro-entrepreneurs in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative research approach by using data collected through semi-structured interviews with several experts and practitioners in crowdfunding, Shariah and entrepreneurship. Prior to discussing the facets of the findings, the data were analysed based on a thematic approach. Findings: The findings reveal that while previous works of related literature suggest crowdfunding as a viable alternative financing option for entrepreneurs and their businesses, in reality, its practical implementation presents challenges. Numerous micro-entrepreneurs need more training in the areas of management and marketing. Such concerns raise questions about their ability to attract potential project backers. With the proper selection of Shariah contracts and several approaches to risk management, Islamic crowdfunding can potentially become an alternative funding source for microbusinesses. Research limitations/implications: Given the exploratory nature of this study regarding the applicability of Islamic crowdfunding as an alternative fund for micro-entrepreneurs, its findings may not fully encompass Malaysia’s context because of the limited number of participants involved. Practical implications: The findings of this study offer guidelines on how to implement Islamic crowdfunding for micro-entrepreneurs. Consequently, Islamic crowdfunding has the potential to alleviate the government’s burden of providing funds for micro-enterprises and enhance their skills and mentality to be more independent, creative and able to promote their products. Social implications: While Islamic crowdfunding can be an alternative opportunity for business enterprises and community-based projects, it promotes the spirit of cooperation and collaboration within society. Originality/value: Although Islamic crowdfunding is a topic that has been discussed previously, empirical investigations in this area remain scarce, mainly through qualitative approaches. Distinguishing from prior literature, this study analyses several potential models of Islamic crowdfunding from the perspectives of experts, practitioners and related agencies for micro-entrepreneurs. Moreover, this study bridges insights from related literature so that they offer practical applications to support micro-entrepreneurs in Malaysia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entrepreneurs; Islamic crowdfunding; Islamic finance; Micro-entrepreneurs","","","","The Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia fully funded this research under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) entitled Developing a \u201CMompreneurFund\u201D Model Based on Islamic Crowdfunding to Empower Single Mother Entrepreneurs in Malaysia (FRGS/1/2021/SS02/UNISZA/02/1).","Razak, Shahrul Azman Abd, COMBINATION OF CONTRACTS IN ISLAMIC FINANCE: A SYNTHESIS, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 8, 2, pp. 51-77, (2016); Islam and Civilisational Renewal, (2016); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Ijief, (2020); Aderemi, Abdulmajeed Muhammad Raji, Qard Hasan as a feasible Islamic financial instrument for crowdfunding: its potential and possible application for financing micro-enterprises in Malaysia, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 15, 1, pp. 58-76, (2023); Muqtasid Jurnal Ekonomi Dan Perbankan Syariah, (2021); Journal of Management Theory and Practice Jmtp, (2021); Ahmed, Habib, Debate on tawarruq: Historical discourse and current rulings, Arab Law Quarterly, 28, 3, pp. 278-294, (2014); Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, (2016)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17554179; 17554187","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169800532"

Despite the growing interest in Waqftech, Malaysian enterprises have not fully embraced this emerging technology because of uncertainty regarding the benefits it offers to contributors. The research incorporates two theoretical frameworks: the electronic data interchange (EDI) model for firms’ technology adoption, and the triple bottom line theory (TBL) for corporate social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative method using a cross-sectional survey design with a five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used. Data was collected from 210 decision-makers representing small and medium-sized enterprises and analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings from this research suggest that Malaysian enterprises are influenced by both corporate and social predictive benefits when using blockchain crowdfunding, but not by environmental benefits. The adoption of blockchain smart contracts does not correlate with predictive environmental benefits because of misconceptions about the disruptive technology’s impact on biological and digital environmental preservation. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on organizational behavior rather than individual users of waqf crowdfunding, and it is limited, primarily focusing within Malaysia and regions with similar waqf structures. Practical implications: The Waqftech framework allows innovative mechanisms for executing corporate waqf investment returns to the intended beneficiaries through the smart contracts’ platform. In addition, this study supports relevant corporate social responsibility and creating shared value technology adoption theories, including EDI and TBL. Aside from this, the study provides empirical implications for waqf management using fintech platforms. Originality/value: This groundbreaking study focuses on creating a Waqftech model for corporate waqf crowdfunding.

It differentiates from prior research by not solely focusing on the 2008 financial crisis. Data from a survey of 220 bank employees were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Key findings include the necessity of well-informed boards and robust governance structures that adhere to regulations for effective risk management. Open communication with stakeholders and stringent control over technological risks are also vital due to the banking sector's increased technology reliance. These insights underscore the complexities of risk management in banking governance, stressing the need for a comprehensive, adaptable strategy. This research contributes new evidence to the importance of strong governance in risk management, with significant implications for bank and corporate governance fields.

This study involved 400 respondents throughout Indonesia including Muslim academicians, BAZNAS (Government Zakat Agency), and Islamic scholars. The research identified five variables influencing Zakat performance: SSGC, ICT capability and GCG elements including transparency, accountability, and credibility. Effective management decisions in implementing and promoting SSGC is crucial for strengthening Zakat performance and, ultimately, enhancing the welfare of society. The finding revealed that GCG elements did not directly affect Zakat performance but was be mediated by SSGC. Transparency, accountability, and credibility significantly affected SSGC, and subsequently SSGC affected Zakat Performance. SSGC strengthened Zakat performance through proactive involvement of government based on religious commitment values in providing regulations and infrastructures, ultimately increasing the welfare of society, highlighting the significance of management decisions in fostering spiritual values within the governance framework. This study introduced SSGC as a new concept in the role of leadership in government theory, by incorporating prophetic servant leadership in Zakat management.

Design/Methodology/Approach — This is a qualitative study using focus group interviews with ten SC members from different Islamic banks in Malaysia. Following the interviews, a thematic analysis of the transcribed data was conducted using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Findings — The participants were generally receptive towards the utilisation of AI tools in the fiqh ruling process at Islamic banks. The participants recognise the potential of AI smart assistants for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the fiqh ruling process. However, they raised some concerns and expectations that need to be addressed. Originality/Value — The novelty of this research comes from sourcing first-hand perspectives of SC members of Islamic banks in Malaysia. Being the end users of AI systems for the fiqh rulings in Islamic banking, it is important to understand their perceptions, concerns and expectations. Research Limitations/Implications — The size of the focus group was limited to ten participants to optimise group size and composition in order to allow adequate participation by each group member. Further sampling from more SC members may elicit additional findings.

A composite index was constructed by principal component analysis using data extracted from the world development indicators, with the components mobile money usage, digital financial services, and velocity of money. The estimation utilised an impulse response function and vector error correction model; the results indicated that mobile money, digital financial services, and money velocity are related in both the short and long term. Furthermore, the application of a standard deviation innovation to the velocity of money produced increases of both positive and negative magnitude for all the variables. This suggests that mobile money, digital banking services, and velocity of money in Ghana are interdependent in an asymmetric manner. In order to facilitate an increase in the velocity of money, the research concluded that policymakers should guarantee that a greater proportion of the population has access to mobile money and digital banking services. In addition to promoting mobile money, online banking services, and digital payment methods on purpose, the government should reduce reliance on physical currency and expedite the circulation of money. It is recommended that future longitudinal studies involving African nations employ diverse estimation techniques. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Banking; Inflation; Mobile Money; Policy rate; Supply of Money; Velocity of Money","","","","","International Journal of Multidisciplinary Innovation and Research Methodology, (2023); Abramova, Svetlana, What can central bank digital currency designers learn from asking potential users ?, pp. 151-170, (2023); Aburbeian, Alsharif Hasan Mohamad, Secure Internet Financial Transactions: A Framework Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication and Machine Learning, AI (Switzerland), 5, 1, pp. 177-194, (2024); Adeosun, Opeoluwa Adeniyi, Uncertainty measures and inflation dynamics in selected global players: a wavelet approach, Quality and Quantity, 57, 4, pp. 3389-3424, (2023); Agarwal, J.

Particularly, economic freedom is low among the Chinese female population. The world average of economic freedom index in 2022 based on 175 countries is 60 index points, but the Chinese index is 48. To address this issue, this study introduced green microfinance institutions based on Mayoux’s Feminist Empowerment Theory. The objective of this study is to examine the role of green microfinance institutions in women economic freedom in China. A survey questionnaire is used to collect data from female clients of microfinance institutions. 315 respondents responded to the survey and data analysis is carried out by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results of the study identified that, green microfinance institution’s services such as credit and insurance can facilitate green micro enterprises. The promotion of green micro enterprises causes to increase women economic security, leading to the economic free-dom. Additionally, green microfinance policy is a critical factor to promote the positive relationship between green microfinance institution’s services and women economic freedom.

The objective will be to gather professional evidence on how the revival of this new technology can bring entrepreneurial development. Design/methodology/approach: Through a qualitative study approach based on applying the metaverse in digital business contexts and analysing 533 practitioner sources from the Nexis Uni database, it will be possible to identify the concepts and application techniques of this emerging technology. The research adopts a qualitative methodology based on a mixed thematic and content review using tools such as ATLAS.ti and Leximancer. Findings: This study finds three relevant macro-topics for metaverse and digital entrepreneurship (technology, immersive and design) and eight concepts (private solutions, digital twins, gamification, public solutions, new business worlds, co-design, collaborative spaces and stakeholders' participation). The uncovered elements demonstrate professionals' interest in a new mode of digital entrepreneurship using the metaverse. This interest highlights the commitment of companies and entrepreneurs toward discovering new services delivered in virtual and parallel worlds that find the creation of digital twins as their essence. Therefore, the study explores ongoing relationships for developing increasingly technically complex metaverse platforms and customer service offerings. Research limitations/implications: The study has some limitations as the selection of the database and the way the cases are focused on, which may be a stimulus for future studies. The analysis has innumerable theoretical and practical implications. In the first case, this research will shed light on an empirical case concerning the conceptual difference between innovation or greater transformation of business models through the metaverse. This work will directly contribute to the global discussion by identifying a model for applying emerging technology to digital entrepreneurs. Finally, from a practical point of view, the authors will provide new insights to digital entrepreneurs by showing them applications, best practices, and platforms they can use for their businesses. Practical implications: On a practical level, the authors show practical opportunities coming from the metaverse for digital entrepreneurs. This study may inspire CEOs, managers, and future entrepreneurs to use the metaverse to expand their businesses by diversifying their services into numerous sectors. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents one of the first efforts to study the metaverse by framing it from theoretical and practical perspectives of digital entrepreneurship. Additionally, future research implications may guide researchers in this brilliant research field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-design digital twins; Digital entrepreneurship; Metaverse; Public value; Qualitative study","","","","","Enterprise Metaverse Services Solutions, (2022); Adobe News, (2022); Álvarez-Risco, Aldo, Social Cognitive Theory to Assess the Intention to Participate in the Facebook Metaverse by Citizens in Peru during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 8, 3, (2022); Arpaci, Ibrahim, Understanding the social sustainability of the Metaverse by integrating UTAUT2 and big five personality traits: A hybrid SEM-ANN approach, Technology in Society, 71, (2022); Biancone, Paolo Pietro, International entrepreneurship and technology: a structured literature review, Contributions to Management Science, pp. 137-159, (2021); Towards A Post Covid Global Financial System, (2022); Boudlaie, Hasan, The role of human resource management in the growth of startups: a multiple case study from the perspective of entrepreneurs and employees, World Review of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development, 18, 3, pp. 307-324, (2022); Buhalis, Dimitrios, Metaverse as a driver for customer experience and value co-creation: implications for hospitality and tourism management and marketing, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 35, 2, pp. 701-716, (2023); Calandra, Davide, The link between sustainable business models and Blockchain: A multiple case study approach, Business Strategy and the Environment, 32, 4, pp. 1403-1417, (2023); A Reality Check for the Metaverse is Coming the Economist, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","13552554","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162631649"

It has not been entirely implemented in the Islamic financial industry because it is unstable and there are debates regarding its conformity with Shariah principles. Since the development of the smart contract is still in the preliminary stages, its position in an Islamic contract is yet to be determined. Does a smart contract blockchain comply with Islamic contract theory? This qualitative study aims to analyse the smart contract’s position based on Islamic contract theory. Data were obtained using content analysis and interview methods, in which the semi-structured interview involved Islamic financial experts and industry players. Data were then analysed using the QDA Miner version 5.0.31 software. Findings indicate that a smart contract differs from other contracts because it records every transaction using hash cryptography and computer codes known as solidity. Besides that, transactions did not adhere to two principles of an Islamic contract, namely the existence of autonomy in the contracting parties and the ability to manipulate the contract. Hence, Shariah-based risks in a smart contract can be decreased by improving the Shariah compliance aspect in the transaction to solve autonomy issues and the manipulation of contracts. The study implies that a smart contract has the potential to become an innovation in the Islamic financial industry if it can adhere to the principles of an Islamic contract and it can be monitored by relevant authorities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; Islamic contract; Islamic finance; Smart contract","","","","","undefined; International Seminar on Islamic Jurisprudence in Contemporary Society at Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, (2017); International Journal of Advanced Research, (2020); Perbankan Islam, (2016); Frontiers in Blockchain, (2020); A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform, (2014); Iqtishoduna Jurnal Ekonomi Islam, (2021); Islamic Financial Services Industry Stability Report, (2016); Revue De Gestion Et D Economie, (2018); International Conference on Islamic Economic, (2022)","","Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry","","","","","","25493167; 25493132","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186172626"

The purpose of this article is to clarify how incorporating blockchain technology would affect estate operations and governance. This study is based on quantitative information that was collected from 317 estate management professionals using a 5point Likert scale questionnaire. SmartPLS4 analysis demonstrates that blockchain governance has a statistically significant and robust influence on estate governance in Jordan. The impact of Blockchain Governance on Jordanian Estate Management appears to be negligible and unimportant. Furthermore, there appears to be a negligible and insignificant correlation between Jordanian estate management and estate planning methods. In-depth analysis of these theories is done in this article, which also offers insights into how blockchain technology affects estate governance dynamics and how it can affect Jordan's estate management procedures. The consequences go beyond theoretical understandings; they promote the use of blockchain technology in estate governance frameworks as a game-changing means of ensuring the safe, transparent, and effective administration of frozen estates in Jordan and elsewhere. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficiency and Transparency; Estate Jordan; Evaluating Security; Governance; Management","","","","","Journal of Administrative Sciences and Fintech Jasf, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2022); Abdullah, Muhamad Muizz, A Literature Review on Islamic Estate Planning From Year 2014 to 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice, 2020, pp. 1-29, (2020); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Ahmad, Iftikhar, Real estate management via a decentralized blockchain platform, Computers, Materials and Continua, 66, 2, pp. 1813-1822, (2020); undefined, (2010); Ahmad, Rohana Binti, Stress among staff in public service organizations: Mapping the relationship between team conflict, personality, and job demands towards job stress, International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 9, 12, pp. 152-161, (2022); Ahmed, Eman Abdulazeem, Comparison of specific segmentation methods used for copy move detection, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 13, 2, pp. 2363-2374, (2023); Risk Management on Inheritance from A Tax Perspective, (2024)","","Growing Science","","","","","","25618156; 25618148","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185464613"

However, the outcome of the path analysis confirmed that perceived value, optimism, and cryptocurrency addiction are significant determinants of continued cryptocurrency usage intention. This study also revealed that financial literacy increases optimism and perceptions of cryptocurrency value. Furthermore, the path analysis shows that the intention to continue cryptocurrency usage is not conditional on trust. These findings add to the literature and theory of cryptocurrency adoption by providing new insights and an advanced understanding of the determining factors of intention to continue cryptocurrency usage.

It is merely due to the huge waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from large-scale production and complex supply chain management processes involved in manufacturing firms. Continuation of the traditional business practices during Industry 4.0 made it impossible for the manufacturing firm to commit to green environmental practices and comply with environmental SDGs. At odd, it requires novel business strategies to ensure compliance of manufacturing firms with environmental sustainable development goals (SDGs). Blockchain is an ideal technology for delivering green environmental-related information because it offers real-time, shareable, and entirely transparent data kept on an immutable ledger that is accessible to members of a network. These green environmental-related information received in real-time through blockchain technology help in the transformation of the traditional supply chain management practices into a more green supply chain management practice. This green transformation ensures business compliance with environmental SDGs and that compliance is shared with multiple stakeholders through blockchain technology in real-time, thus approving a positive mediating role of green supply chain management practices between blockchain technology and environmental SDGs performance. The proposed strategic framework through various propositions development will mainly offer policy insights toward (a) identifying novel antecedents of blockchain technology, (b) offering insights toward upgrading the traditional supply chain management framework into a green supply chain management framework, and (c) illuminating novel mediating role of green supply chain management practices between blockchain technology and environmental SDGs performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain technology; environmental SDGs; green supply chain management","firm size; industrial development; manufacturing; performance assessment; supply chain management; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; waste management","","","This study is supported via funding from the Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University project number (PSAU/2023/R/1444).","Agbo, Cornelius Chidubem, Blockchain technology in healthcare: A systematic review, Healthcare (Switzerland), 7, 2, (2019); Agyabeng-Mensah, Yaw, Green warehousing, logistics optimization, social values and ethics and economic performance: the role of supply chain sustainability, International Journal of Logistics Management, 31, 3, pp. 549-574, (2020); Ahmed, Waqar, Exploring firm performance by institutional pressures driven green supply chain management practices, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 8, 5, pp. 415-437, (2019); Albayati, Hayder, Accepting financial transactions using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency: A customer perspective approach, Technology in Society, 62, (2020); Asif, Muhammad Salman, Adoption of green supply chain management practices through collaboration approach in developing countries – From literature review to conceptual framework, Journal of Cleaner Production, 276, (2020); Blockchain for Securing Sustainable Transport Contracts and Supply Chain Transparency an Explorative Study of Blockchain Technology in Logistics, (2016); Digit 2019 Proceedings, (2019); Bartolini, Maicol, Green warehousing: Systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 226, pp. 242-258, (2019); Bhaskar, Preeti, Blockchain in education management: present and future applications, Interactive Technology and Smart Education, 18, 1, pp. 1-17, (2020); Bhuniya, Shaktipada, A smart production process for the optimum energy consumption with maintenance policy under a supply chain management, Processes, 9, 1, pp. 1-23, (2021)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173439742"

The findings support our maintained assumption that due to the economics of electronic platforms perused by financial technology firms, these firms outperform firms from other industries (non-Fintech). The final sample comprises 1,712 company-year observations between 2010 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19). The evidence suggests that our corporate governance quality index, developed from Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (www.oecd.org/corporate/corporate-governance-factbook.htm, 2019) guidelines, accurately captures corporate governance quality in the United States, principally due to the inclusion of an anti-bribery policy indicator, in the index. The results suggest that this evidence is not merely an artefact due to the corporate governance quality index potentially capturing priced risk factors. Our findings reveal that fintech firms have superior corporate governance quality than non-fintech and that fintech firms place more reliance on internal versus external corporate governance mechanisms, vis-a-vis companies in other industries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency costs; Corporate governance (CG); COVID-19; Financial technology firms; Performance; Regulations","Costs; Industrial economics; Agency costs; Corporate governance; Electronic platforms; Financial technology firm; Firm Performance; Organization of economic co-operation and development; Performance; Quality indices; Regulation; COVID-19","","","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the funding and research support received from Sunway University, Malaysia.

As one of the leading wheat importers, Egypt has been adversely affected by the simultaneous occurrence of these two events. Baladi bread is an integral part of the daily diet in Egypt, so any disruption affecting its availability can have a severe impact on the country’s food security. This study aims to simulate the causes and effects of potential disruptions that could occur, such as increased transportation time, unavailability of sourcing, and surge in demand due to lockdowns and panic buying. The East Cairo region was chosen as a case study to model the Baladi bread supply chain. A discrete-event simulation model was developed using anyLogistix software (version 2.15.1) for this study. Five key performance indicators were selected to evaluate, analyze, and compare the outcomes of each scenario in terms of the performance and operation of the food supply chain: service level by product, lead time, demand backlog, average daily available inventory in the mills, and on-hand inventory of wheat in the silos. The results indicate that the supply chain has been significantly impacted by the disruptions caused by these two events, leading to decreased availability of Baladi bread, unmet demand, extended lead times, and high backlogs. By utilizing the research findings, proactive strategies can be developed to minimize the impact of such disruptions in the future and maximize food security and supply chain resilience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bread; COVID-19; food supply chain; Russian–Ukrainian war; service level; simulation","COVID-19; food security; food supply; simulation; software; supply chain management; wheat; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt","","","","Mari, Sonia Irshad, Sustainable and resilient supply chain network design under disruption risks, Sustainability (Switzerland), 6, 10, pp. 6666-6686, (2014); Elkington, John, Partnerships from cannibals with forks: The triple bottom line of 21st-century business, Environmental Quality Management, 8, 1, pp. 37-51, (1998); Mostafa, Noha A., Promoting organizational sustainability and innovation: An exploratory case study from the Egyptian chemical industry, Procedia Manufacturing, 22, pp. 1007-1014, (2018); Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, (2020); Huremović, Damir, Psychiatry of Pandemics: A Mental Health Response to Infection Outbreak, pp. 1-185, (2019); Adjusting Business Models to Sustain Agri Food Enterprises During Covid 19, (2020); Di Domenico, Laura, Impact of lockdown on COVID-19 epidemic in Île-de-France and possible exit strategies, BMC Medicine, 18, 1, (2020); Ren, Xuefei, Pandemic and lockdown: a territorial approach to COVID-19 in China, Italy and the United States, Eurasian Geography and Economics, 61, 4-5, pp. 423-434, (2020); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Ijief, (2021); undefined, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184697338"

A balanced regulatory framework is required to protect consumers and to encourage digital Islamic finance innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on Indonesia and compares it to other countries, specifically Malaysia and the UK, using statutory, comparative and conceptual research approaches. Findings: The ICAs are permissible (halal) commodities/assets to be traded if they fulfil the standards as goods or commodities that can be traded with a sale and purchase contract (sil’ah) and have an underlying asset (backed by tangible assets such as gold). Islamic social finance activities such as zakat and Islamic microfinance activities such as halal industry are backed by ICAs. The regulatory framework needed to support ICAs includes the Islamic Financial Services Act, shariah supervisory boards, shariah governance standards and ICA exchanges. Research limitations/implications: This study only examined crypto assets (tokens as securities) and not cryptocurrencies. It used regulations in several countries with potential in Islamic finance development, such as Indonesia, Malaysia and the UK. Practical implications: The ICA regulatory framework is helpful as an element of a comprehensive strategy to develop a lasting Islamic social finance ecosystem. Social implications: The development of crypto assets must be supported by a regulatory framework to protect consumers and encourage innovation in Islamic digital finance. Originality/value: ICA has growth prospects; however, weak regulatory support and minimal oversight indicate weak legal protection for consumers and investors. Regulating ICA, optimising supervision, implementing shariah governance standards and having ICA exchanges can strengthen the Islamic economic ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic crypto asset exchanges; Islamic crypto assets; Shariah compliance; Shariah governance standards","","","","","Alahouel, Fatma, Islamic stock-sukuk indexes' correlations: does financial uncertainty matter?, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 17, 8, pp. 1840-1864, (2022); Metode Penelitian Hukum, (2010); Journal of Contemporary Islamic Studies, (2020); Aloui, Chaker, Are Islamic gold-backed cryptocurrencies different?, Finance Research Letters, 39, (2021); Aloui, Chaker, Price discovery and regime shift behavior in the relationship between sharia stocks and sukuk: A two-state Markov switching analysis, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 34, pp. 121-135, (2015); Proyek Garuda Menavigasi Arsitektur Digital Rupiah, (2022); Ini Kelebihan Aset Kripto Dibanding Yang Lain, (2022); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2022); Billah, Mohd Ma Sum, Modern Islamic Investment Management: Principles and Practices, pp. 1-248, (2019); What is Islamic Economics What is Wrong with Islamic Economics, (2013)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","1754243X; 17542448","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174261672"

However, along with the myriad of benefits, it also has the potential to induce risks to individuals, organisations and society. This study focuses on understanding FinTech developers’ perspective of the dark side of FinTech. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 Nigerian FinTech developers using an exploratory, inductive methodology The data were transcribed and then thematically analysed using NVivo. Findings: Three themes – customer vulnerability, technical inability and regulatory irresponsibility – arose from the thematic analysis. The poor existing technological infrastructure, data management challenges, limited access to data and smartphone adoption pose challenges to a speedy integration of FinTech in the country, making customers vulnerable. The lack of privacy control leads to ethical issues. The lack of skilled developers and the brain drain of good developers present additional obstacles to the development of FinTech in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: FinTech operation in a developing country differs from that in developed countries with better technological infrastructure and institutional acceptance. This study recognises that basic banking operations through FinTech are still not well adopted, necessitating the need to be more open-minded about the global practicalities of FinTech. Practical implications: FinTech managers, banks and policymakers can ethically collect consumer data that can help influence customer credit decisions, product development and recommendations using the mobile app and transaction history. There should be strict penalties on FinTech for selling customers’ data, sending unsolicited messages or gaining unnecessary access to the customer’s contact list. FinTech can offer to educate consumers about their financial management skills. Originality/value: Whereas other studies have focused on the positive aspects of FinTech to understand client perceptions, this study offers new insights into the dark side of FinTech by analysing the viewpoints of FinTech developers. Furthermore, the study is based in Nigeria, an emerging economy adopting FinTech, adding a new dimension to the body of knowledge. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Dark side; Financial services; FinTech; FinTech developers; Qualitative study","","","","Addressing the technical inability, we recognise the environmental factor that may motivate tech workers in Nigeria (as a developing country) to choose to migrate and work in other developed countries, but notwithstanding, FinTech companies need to ensure they improve the human resources pipeline in the industry; they need to offer better working conditions, offer training to recruit and retain talent and possibly work with higher education institutions to help develop more talent to champion the anticipated digital transformation within the FinTech sector. Entrepreneur skills and initiatives from perspective tech developers working on innovative FinTech ideas should also be supported through funding, grants and capital venture investments. This support will move the scope of FinTech beyond just buying airtime and processing payments to the other end of the spectrum, such as open banking, credit ratings and cryptocurrencies. Banks and FinTech managers should also be able to hold themselves responsible and self-regulate their operations. As managers in the interview alluded to the “bad eggs” within the industry and previous studies highlight some unethical banking operations that can jeopardise customers’ trust (), banks should be able to address these dark sides, open channels for whistleblowing and ensure trust in the sector. The trade association and self-regulatory organisation for FinTech also have a role to play in disseminating information about re-registered members to allay fears and curb the sector of exploitative developers.","Abdulkadir, Shehu, The Study of Islamic P2P Crowd Funding Model as an Alternative to SME Financing in Nigeria, Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud, pp. 129-138, (2022); Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Mogaji, Emmanuel, Marketing bank services to financially vulnerable customers: evidence from an emerging economy, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 39, 3, pp. 402-428, (2021); Digital Innovations Business and Society in Africa, (2022); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, Control of fraud on mobile money services in Ghana: an exploratory study, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 22, 2, pp. 300-317, (2019); Akter, Shahriar, Algorithmic bias in data-driven innovation in the age of AI, International Journal of Information Management, 60, (2021); Alam, Md Mahmudul, Using e-wallet for business process development: challenges and prospects in Malaysia, Business Process Management Journal, 27, 4, pp. 1142-1162, (2021); Alt, Rainer, Electronic Markets and current general research, Electronic Markets, 28, 2, pp. 123-128, (2018); Alt, Rainer, FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 28, 3, pp. 235-243, (2018); Amankwah-Amoah, Joseph, Technological revolution, sustainability, and development in Africa: Overview, emerging issues, and challenges, Sustainable Development, 27, 5, pp. 910-922, (2019)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164321909"

The authors use an extended version of the technology acceptance model to develop a causal–predictive analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The research model and hypotheses were tested by applying partial least square-structured equation modeling to data collected from 214 users of Islamic banking in Saudi Arabia. Findings: The results show that perceived trust has a highly significant direct effect on the intention to use Islamic Paytech services, whereas perceived risk has a significant indirect effect on IU. Research limitations/implications: Internet banking behavior may not be static. In technology acceptance, during the various phases from introduction to the maturity phase, the respondent’s perceptions tend to change Practical implications: From the point of view of Fintech services providers, the knowledge of the factors fostering the adoption of Fintech services would allow an international expansion without the inconvenience of establishing offices or companies in countries whose legislation does not favor the operations carried out by Islamic banks. Social implications: These digital payment services would allow access to financial services to the entire Muslim population regardless of their location (Islamic and non-Islamic nations) and will also reach out to the next generation of young Muslims as a majority are “digital natives” ready for digital Islamic financial solutions. Originality/value: This study is the first to explore the intention to use Paytech services by Islamic banking users in Saudi Arabia. From a theoretical perspective, this work contributes to the academic literature by analyzing the intention to use Paytech services in an Islamic banking context. On the practical front, the study identifies the crucial factors that industry players can use to design their Paytech applications and services to increase financial inclusion in Saudi Arabia and other countries with similar cultures as well as to design an international expansion without the inconvenience of establishing offices or companies in countries whose legislation does not favor the operations carried out by Islamic banks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Extended TAM; Intention to use; Islamic Fintech; Islamic Paytech; PLSpredict","","","","Funding: This research was funded by the University of Seville under grant to the Research Group [SEJ-566].","Libro Blanco De Paytech, (2020); Nawayseh, Mohammad, Fintech in COVID-19 and beyond: What factors are affecting customers’ choice of fintech applications?, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 6, 4, pp. 1-15, (2020); International Journal of Managing Information Technology, (2016); Atif, Mohd, Islamic FinTech: The digital transformation bringing sustainability to islamic finance, pp. 91-103, (2021); Ayub, Muhammad, Understanding Islamic Finance, pp. 1-516, (2015); Banna, Hasanul, Fintech-based financial inclusion and bank risk-taking: Evidence from OIC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 75, (2021); Marketing Research, (2000); Chishti, Susanne, The PayTech book: The payment technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs, and FinTech visionaries, pp. 1-242, (2019); Davis, Fred D.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Management Science, (1989)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17538394; 17538408","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160334283"

It explores substantive requirements, including the lawful subject matter and legitimate creditor interests, alongside formal stipulations such as notarisation and registry enrolment to ensure enforceability against third parties. Employing a comparative legal analysis, the study evaluates Saudi legislation in relation to international conventions and regional frameworks, including those of Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain, to identify regulatory strengths and shortcomings. The findings, as presented in the table, indicate that Saudi law aligns with or exceeds international standards in areas such as mortgagor covenants (e.g., usage restrictions) and mortgagee remedies (e.g., priority claims). Nevertheless, procedural issues remain, particularly in the domains of electronic registry utilisation, procedural frameworks, and creditor enforcement mechanisms. According to what the current study suggests, if carried out properly, improvements to the legal requirements for recognition, registration, and creditor rights might bring down legal risks and throw their weight behind sector investments by an estimated percentage ranging from 20–40%. The significance of maritime mortgage systems lies in its standing up for the interests of creditors and in giving a boost to investment and stability in the marine industry, two aspects that are brought to light by this study. In order to keep an eye on creditors better, it is suggested in this study that i) a single electronic registry for marine affairs be put in place, ii) the regulations governing pledge cancellations be cleared up, and iii) enforcement rights be emboldened. By virtue of pushing for greater global competitiveness, these policies seek to serve three main purposes: i) supporting Saudi maritime legislation, ii) looking out for the interests of domestic players, and iii) making headway toward meeting the Vision 2030 goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contract Formation; Creditor's Rights; Maritime Mortgagee; Mortgagee; Mortgagor; Saudi Legal System","","","","The researcher is pleased to extend sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University for its encouragement and moral support throughout the completion of this research.","Ajeeb, Samar, The impact of the mortgage on the real estate market: a study case in Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis, 17, 2, pp. 329-344, (2024); Al-Qahtani, Shahad, THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS IN ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS: THE CASE OF SAUDI ARABIA, Access to Justice in Eastern Europe, 6, special issue, pp. 1-17, (2023); Alamer, Saleh Abdulrahman, Interest and Banks in Saudi Arabia: A Dilemma, Arab Law Quarterly, 36, 1-2, pp. 49-85, (2020); Alazzam, Farouq Ahmad Faleh, WAYS OF IMPROVING TRADE IN JORDAN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW, Financial and Credit Activity: Problems of Theory and Practice, 4, 51, pp. 417-428, (2023); Alharbi, Raed Khamis, Early impact of Covid-19 on private sector employees finance homeownership in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis, 16, 1, pp. 5-21, (2023); Alomari, Mohammad A., Utilising law in the transition of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to a low-carbon economy, Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions, 39, pp. 107-118, (2021); Amuda, Yusuff Jelili, Reinforcing policy and legal framework for Islamic insurance in Islamic finance: towards achieving Saudi Arabia Vision 2030, International Journal of Law and Management, 65, 6, pp. 600-613, (2023); Legal Brief, (2022); undefined, (2022); International Journal of Computer Science Network Security, (2022)","","International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences","","","","","","09735089","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000785414"

Employing a qualitative research method, this research will interview procurement managers and industry experts to obtain first-hand data from both sides. Findings indicate these digital technologies are enhancing procurement efficiencies, transparency, and strategic decision-making. In the same breath though, we learn that challenges remain such as how to meet regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions; who has access to what data (and when?); and what kind of staff to hire or develop. Three main themes arise from our data: how economic theories are being married up with digital procurement practices; obstacles in technology adoption; and innovative opportunities for diversity within procurement--transforming this division's structure or ways it interfaces with other parts out there. The study concludes with the finding that shared efforts are the key to knowing which way digital transformation is going. Put simply, Policymakers must join hands with business leaders and developers of technology to solve the complexities engendered by turning an industry around through digital means successfully.

Despite these advantages, crypto assets pose several challenges from a fiqh perspective. Firstly, there are discrepancies among researchers attempting to define them. Secondly, technological complexities have led to misunderstandings of their concept. Thirdly, there is a general misconception about their similarity to Bitcoin. Fourthly, there is a notable dearth of comprehensive fiqh studies on the topic. Therefore, this study has adopted a qualitative method to address these four research gaps in extant literature. It has critically reviewed the literature to identify the issues and propose a definition of crypto assets and has categorized them into six types. Content analysis research method was used to develop a conceptual framework for the fiqh analysis of crypto assets.

Furthermore, it examines the moderating role of institutional support in the relationship between Maqashid al-Shariah and SDGs. Primary data was collected from Islamic banks, and Smart-PLS was used to analyze the relationships between the variables.

Based on the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, the results using an electronic survey of 391 metaverse consumers among metaverse Islamic mobile banking services show that consumer trust based on its priors (perceived risk, perceived reputation, service quality, and perceived regulatory support) has a significant influence on consumer behavior intention at a significant P-value level (< 0.001). Furthermore, the results affirm that Task-Technology Fit plays a significant role in consumer behavior intention at a significant P-value level (< 0.001). Moreover, consumer behavior intention has a significant influence on consumers’ decision to adopt metaverse Islamic mobile banking services in Jordan at a significant P-value level (< 0.001).

The main research object of this paper is the digital currency that incorporates blockchain and smart contract technology, and it deeply examines how its generation and development impact economic policy and the corresponding regulatory mechanism. The application of blockchain and smart contract technology is used to analyze the characteristics and performance of digital currency, and the advantages and shortcomings of using digital currency are briefly explained. Based on the analysis of related research and practical application requirements, digital currency is being introduced into the DSGE model, which includes households, manufacturers, and other sectors. Impulse response and variance decomposition are used to numerically simulate the impact of digital currency on economic policy and the effectiveness of the regulatory mechanism. The economic policy transmission efficiency is the lowest in the no digital currency scenario, while it is significantly higher in the scenario of full use of digital currency, with interest rate shocks into the maximum degree of change in output and inflation of 0.059% and 0.121%. The variance of each macroeconomic variable in the economic policy regulation scenario shows a significant downward trend, and digital currency contributes to the overall regulation effect of macroeconomic policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Digital currency; DSGE model; Impulse response; Smart contract; Variance decomposition","Blockchain; Block-chain; Development impacts; DSGE models; Economic policies; Impact mechanism; Performance; Regulation mechanisms; Regulatory mechanism; Research object; Variance decomposition; Inflation","","","","Bis Quarterly Review, (2020); International Journal of Researchgranthaalayah, (2020); Implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies for Monetary Policy Transmission, (2023); Ozili, Peterson K., Central bank digital currency research around the world: a review of literature, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 26, 2, pp. 215-226, (2023); Keister, Todd, Central bank digital currency: Stability and information, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 142, (2022); Central Bank Digital Currency Motivations and Implications, (2017); Nber Reporter, (2018); Wu, Yanbing, A regulated digital currency, Science China Information Sciences, 62, 3, (2019); Lee, David Kuo Chuen, A global perspective on central bank digital currency, China Economic Journal, 14, 1, pp. 52-66, (2021); Rehman, Mubeen Abdur, Macro-financial implications of central bank digital currencies, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023)","","Sciendo","","","","","","24448656","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206811409"

Design/methodology/approach: Citation, conceptual and structural knowledge analyses were used through Biblioshiny to uncover current trends, impacts, and well-developed themes from 2274 journals. Findings: The results showed that there was a shift of focus to IB identity, governance and performance toward customer behavior related to the new generation, and the influence of digital technology such as blockchain, meta-verse, and social media platforms on the adoption of Islamic finance and banking services. Research limitations/implications: Further research enriching the current knowledge on IB’s economic impact, governance, identity and performance across different contexts must support the understanding since the result is related to the understanding of new generation customer behavior and technology adoption. Originality/value: The broader scope of the literature was reviewed for holistic analysis of issues and opportunities benefiting various stakeholders through interdisciplinary research.

Islamic Social Finance (ISF), especially through productive waqf instruments, is one of the prospective solutions to overcome this problem. Although Indonesia has enormous waqf potential, waqf realisation is still very low. There are several challenges in the waqf collection process, namely low literacy or public awareness, unprofessional management, and a lack of qualified human resources (nazhir). This research aims to determine the optimal productive waqf model to be implemented in Indonesia using the Delphi ANP-BOCR method. To strengthen the research results, this study also conducted a meta-analysis as a form of robustness check and a benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) analysis of each model as supporting arguments. The findings of this study show that Islamic banks as a way to leverage funds for waqf are the most prioritised model. This is because Islamic banks act as intermediary institutions that have great potential for optimising the collection and management of waqf funds, which can increase economic growth. This is reinforced by the results obtained from the meta-analysis and several supporting arguments, which show that Islamic financial institutions (including Islamic banks) can improve community welfare through the utilisation of social funds (including waqf). Besides that, this research also discusses an alternative model of productive waqf through digitalisation by adopting several technologies that aim to increase efficiency, transparency, and accessibility so as to optimise the collection and management of waqf funds more effectively and efficiently. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delphi ANP-BOCR; Islamic finance; Meta-analysis; Productive waqf","","","","","J Ekon Dan Kebijak Publik, (2015); Memahami Kembali Strategi Pengentasan Kemiskinan Di Indonesia, (2024); J Esa Unggul, (2007); Persentase Penduduk Miskin September 2022 Naik Menjadi 9 57 Persen, (2023); Iqtishaduna J Ilm Ekon Kita, (2019); Cattelan, Valentino, Islamic social finance: Entrepreneurship, cooperation and the sharing economy, pp. 1-222, (2018); Towards A Post Covid Global Financial System, (2022); Islamic Social Finance Report 2020, (2020); Tahiri-Jouti, Ahmed, An integrated approach for building sustainable Islamic social finance ecosystems, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 11, 2, pp. 246-266, (2019); Islamic Economic Studies, (1998)","","Learning Gate","","","","","","25768484","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205926196"

In the current era of information banking management, characterized by global interconnectedness and sustainability, the adoption of blockchain technology has brought about substantial changes in the banking sector. Despite the growing interest in blockchain’s applications within banking industry, both from academics and professionals in banking, finance, and fintech, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive review that offers a holistic understanding of the historical, current, and future trends of blockchain in banking. Existing reviews on blockchain in banking have primarily focused on conceptual aspects, such as constructing theoretical frameworks, or contextual elements, such as examining cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers. Consequently, these reviews offer a limited and incomplete understanding of the entire field. To bridge this gap, the present review takes a different approach by conducting a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 133 articles on blockchain published in Scopus-indexed journals from 2015 to May 2023. This methodology allows for a more extensive exploration of the literature, providing a more robust and comprehensive overview of blockchain’s application in the banking sector. Consequently, this comprehensive review uncovers significant trends in article performance, author contributions, country involvement, journal impact and theme within the field of blockchain research in banking.

However, the performance of ISF in Indonesia, both in terms of collection and management, is still far from expectations. To address this problem, a digital transformation of ISF is needed by leveraging technologies that come with both advantages and disadvantages. This study employs a Delphi ANP-BOCR analysis to determine the most optimal technology for ISF digitalization, which result is supported by meta-analysis findings. The result shows that cloud computing is the most optimal technology when only benefits and costs are evaluated. When all factors, including benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, are considered, digital platform proves to be the most optimal technology for both the short and long term.

Data were collected through in-depth interviews with various e-commerce users, including consumers and producers. The results reveal that producers generally have a higher awareness of justice and ma maṣlaḥah in e-commerce, though their application of these principles varies. Consumers' experiences are inconsistent, often influenced by their educational background and exposure to Islamic commerce teachings. Key challenges include the lack of standardized guidelines and divergent interpretations of fiqh muamalah principles. The study underscores the need for more structured education and regulatory frameworks to ensure these principles' effective and consistent integration into e-commerce practices.

However, there is an obscurity with respect to protecting consumers’ rights and creating a reliable atmosphere for digital finance through legal framework in the digital banking sector in the Kingdom. The primary aims and objectives of this research is to scrutinize the digital banking consumers’ protection legal framework being overseen in Saudi Arabia, analyzing its content, mechanisms, and impact on different stakeholders. Similarly, the study tires to determine its efficacy as well as identify the roadblocks which can prevent its success. Through an extensive review and examination, the evaluation defines key issues, difficulties and finalizes statements about the legal field. The content analysis methodology was used to help address issues emanating from the existing literature. Various scholarly articles, policy documents, and regulatory guidelines were explored. In other words, data for this study were collected through different search sources such as journals, traditional articles of Google Scholar, policy documents, and library sources. A total of 25 articles were explored and contributed immensely to unveiling various aspects of the legal framework of digital banking as well as consumers’ protection in the Kingdom. The findings of this investigation have identified three basic themes on the domestic legal regulation of consumers’ protection in the digital banking system in Saudi Arabia. First, the study has analyzed various legislations such as: consumer protection law, sector-specific regulations, among others concerning the rights and duties of consumer protection. Second, legal obligations in seeking remedies when there is a discriminatory treatment in digital banking services. Third, it has been established that Saudi Arabia have taken a proactive step towards a robust safety cushion to protect the consumer rights and minimizing the risks involved in cybersecurity in the context of Saudi Arabia. Theoretically, on one hand, the study highlights the paramount significance to consumers’ protection legislations in the Kingdom. On the other hand, practically, the Kingdom’s witness of rapid economic growth and technological advancement, ensuring robust consumer protection measures becomes increasingly paramount to foster trust, promote fair business practices, and enhance consumer confidence in the marketplace. Nonetheless, some limitations such as insufficient consumers’ education and regulatory inadequacies were noted which need national coordination between stakeholders. Notwithstanding the fact that the legal framework exhibits strong points especially in addressing vital issues, its timely evaluation, amendment, and enforcement is deemed as a key to solve the emerging challenges and obtain confidence of consumers when it comes to digital banking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","consumer protection; digital banking and consumer rights; legal framework; Saudi Arabia","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication.","AboAlsamh, Hoda Mahmoud, Pioneering Perception of Green Fintech in Promoting Sustainable Digital Services Application within Smart Cities, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 14, (2023); Abu Ali, Mahmoud, The role of green infrastructure in enhancing microclimate conditions: A case study of a low-rise neighborhood in Abu Dhabi, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 8, (2021); Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi, Sustainable urban planning strategies for mitigating climate change in Saudi Arabia, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 22, 6, pp. 5129-5152, (2020); J Digit Bank, (2025); Investingating the Effect of Urban from on Heat Island Phenomena, (2017); Addas, Abdullah, Role of urban greening strategies for environmental sustainability-a review and assessment in the context of Saudi Arabian megacities, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Defense Associations for Bank Users Comparative Analysis of French and Saudi Practices, (2022); Ahmad, Naveed, Csr communication through social media: A litmus test for banking consumers’ loyalty, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-16, (2021); Aina, Yusuf Adedoyin, Top-down sustainable urban development?

This trend illustrates a profound transformation within the Islamic world, where the pillars of faith are being reimagined and revitalized through the lens of technological advancement. The present study delved into the factors influencing the young Muslim generation’s preference for digital platforms in Zakat transactions across Indonesia and Malaysia. We examined variables such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Trust, Zakat Literacy, and Digital Infrastructure, aiming to discern their impact on the propensity for digital Zakat contributions with the extension of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The research encompassed a diverse sample of 382 participants and utilized advanced methodologies, specifically Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS Multi Group Analysis (PLS-MGA), for rigorous data analysis. The results indicated that Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Digital Infrastructure, and Zakat Literacy notably influenced the use of digital platforms for Zakat. Furthermore, PLS-MGA uncovered significant cross-country differences where Digital Infrastructure showed a more pronounced positive impact in Malaysian context, whereas Social Influence had a greater effect in Indonesia. These findings offer critical insights into the young Muslim community’s digital engagement for religious financial obligations, underscoring the need for tailored digital Zakat solutions that cater to the unique preferences of this demographic. This research not only enriches the understanding of digital adoption in religious practices but also challenges the notion of a universal approach, advocating for context-specific strategies in the realm of digital religious financial services. Future researchers are suggested to consider longitudinal investigations as well as examining cross-regional contexts in this realm of research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital platforms; PLS-MGA; PLS-SEM; poverty alleviation; Zakat payments","","","","","International Journal of Islamic Business and Economics Ijibec, (2021); Islamic Economic Studies, (2023); Key to Happiness Indonesian, (2004); Al-Saedi, Karrar, Developing a general extended UTAUT model for M-payment adoption, Technology in Society, 62, (2020); Jurnal Manajemen, (2018); Technology Equality is the Key to National Awakening Cnbc Indonesia Indonesian, (2021); This is the Number of Muslim Population in the Asean Region Indonesia is the Largest, (2023); Jurnal Menara Ekonomi Penelitian Dan Kajian Ilmiah Bidang Ekonomi, (2018); World Scientific Annual Review of Islamic Finance, (2023); Fund Receipt Report Infak Id Indonesian, (2022)","","EnPress Publisher, LLC","","","","","","25727931; 25727923","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202917152"

The decision to launch a digital currency mainly depends upon the goals and objectives being set by the Central Bank of any respective country. Digital currencies help to implement monetary policy more effectively to achieve the financial system stability. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the Commonwealth of Independent States region; the digital payments market is changing rapidly in Kazakhstan, being driven by fintech innovations and public investments in payment technologies. In this article, we thoroughly discussed how launching of “Digital Tenge” is promoting financial inclusion and strengthening the monetary regulations across Kazakhstan. We took the case of Kazakhstan because it’s the first country from Central Asia which took the initiative of launching digital currency, and the National Bank of Kazakhstan has already announced that implementation of “Digital Tenge” would be completed in Kazakhstan by the end of 2025. The implementation of a “Digital Tenge” as a CBDC in Kazakhstan would expand the range of financial services being available to the nation. Having direct authority over the digital currency will empower the National Bank of Kazakhstan to adopt more efficient monetary policy, exerting influence over interest rates, money supply, and general economic stability. Furthermore, by providing digital financial services to marginalized communities, the digital Tenge would also help to solve the difficulties of financial inclusion in Kazakhstan. The article provides the possible policy routes for the governments of developing countries and the financial regulators about adopting CBDCs for promoting financial inclusion and to strengthen the monetary regulations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","central bank; digital tenge; financial inclusion; Kazakhstan; monetary policy","","","","","Agarwal, J.

Islamic finance, emphasizing social justice and accountability, has gained significant traction as a prudent alternative to conventional finance. Key instruments such as Musharaka, Ijara, Sukuk, Mudaraba, and Takaful are analyzed for their unique accounting and auditing requirements. The fragmented nature of the global Islamic finance ecosystem, characterized by diverse geographic and sectarian interpretations, presents significant challenges to establishing a unified financial reporting framework. Despite the rapid growth and innovation in Islamic banking, the lack of a standardized reporting system that aligns with both Islamic principles and international standards remains a critical issue. This study emphasizes the need for a cohesive approach involving global standard-setting bodies, Islamic finance experts, and regulators to develop comprehensive standards that ensure consistency, transparency, and reliability in financial reporting. Ultimately, this research advocates for a unified financial reporting system that accommodates the unique characteristics of Islamic financial instruments while aligning with global financial standards. Such a system will enhance the credibility and acceptance of Islamic finance, fostering its growth and contributing to the stability and inclusiveness of the global financial system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AAOIFI; Auditing standards; Financial regulation; financial reporting; Global financial system; IFRS; Islamic banking; Islamic finance; Justice; Musharaka; Social","","","","","Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Karim, Rifaat Ahmed Abdel, The Nature and Rationale of a Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting by Islamic Banks, Accounting and Business Research, 25, 100, pp. 285-300, (1995); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Abu-Tapanjeh, Abdussalam Mahmoud, Corporate governance from the Islamic perspective: A comparative analysis with OECD principles, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 20, 5, pp. 556-567, (2009); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2020); International Journal of Digital Accounting and Fintech Sustainability, (2024); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Human and Social Studies, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2022); Al Zaytoonah University of Jordan Journal for Legal Studies, (2023)","","Elite Scientific Publications","","","","","","17274915; 22217630","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201864388"

To unlock the potential of waqf institutions, a supportive enabling environment is necessary. Hence, the issues of a conducive environment faced by the waqf stakeholders in Indonesia and Singapore need to be explored. Dual authorities’ roles are examined in addressing the issues. 22 in-depth interviews, 3 focus group discussions, observations, and reviews of relevant documents (regulations, reports, news, etc.) are conducted in Indonesia – a majority Muslim, and Singapore – a minority Muslim country. Collected data are then analysed thematically employing the lens of organisational legitimacy theory. This study shows that institutional challenges confound waqf developments as well as waqf stakeholders’ interest in the two countries under study. While the challenges faced by waqf institutions are prevalent in the existing regulatory environment, they also bring embedded consequences to waqf administration and policies. In Indonesia, the multiple conflicting roles of the Indonesian Waqf Board (Badan Wakaf Indonesia/BWI) and dual waqf authorities between the Ministry of Religious Authorities (Kementrian Agama/Kemenag) and BWI present institutional challenges that cause ineffective governing functions of waqf authorities. In Singapore, institutional challenges in the form of multiple roles of MUIS along with their government-affiliated policy direction raised concerns on conflict of roles and centralized administration, which caused national policy vis a vis social inclusion trade-off for the waqf. From the organizational legitimacy perspective, waqf authorities need to embrace the stakeholders’ expectations to focus on and enhance their roles as regulators and supervisors of the waqf sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Institutional Challenge; Legitimacy; Waqf; Waqf Authorities","","","","","A History of Philanthropic Foundations the Islamic World from the Seventh Century to the Present, (2000); Wife Uitm Occasional Papers, (2014); A Paper Presented at 17th Middle East History and Theory Conference, (2002); Embracing Waqf as A Lifestyle in Digital Era Opinion the Jakarta Post, (2019); Awqaf Experiences in South Asia, (2002); Amin, Hanudin, Determinants of online waqf acceptance: An empirical investigation, Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries, 60, 1, pp. 1-18, (2014); An Organisational Legitimacy Study on Governance of Waqf Authorities in Indonesia and Singapore, (2021); Sukmana, Raditya, Critical assessment of Islamic endowment funds (Waqf) literature: lesson for government and future directions, Heliyon, 6, 10, (2020); Islamic Wealth Management Inaugural Colloquium, (2013); International Journal of Not for Profit Law, (2016)","","Hamdard Foundation Pakistan","","","","","","02507196","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200927093"

The shortcomings could be resolved by introducing Web 3.0 to Malaysia's financial industry. This research aimed to explore the factors that influenced the adoption of Web 3.0 financial systems among Malaysian adults. Firstly, a Web 3.0 prototype system was developed with Web 3.0 design features. The web system’s interfaces were included in the questionnaire form, where 150 Malaysian adults were prompted to respond with their agreement on whether the factors of decentralization, security, transparency, accessibility, effectiveness, learnability, and ease of use are important and have positive significant relationships with intention to use Web 3.0 financial systems. The findings from hypothesis analysis found that only the factors of transparency, security, and accessibility had positive relationships with the intention to use Web 3.0 financial systems among Malaysian adults. The findings were later proposed as Malaysia Web 3.0 financial systems’ design framework, and further analyzed with the K-Means clustering method, for the benefit of Web 3.0 industry players to better understand adult users’ preferences.

Due to the unclear existence and mechanism for implementing khiyar al-majlis in electronic contracts, this research was urgent. The aim of this research was to determine the existence and mechanism for implementing khiyar al-majlis in electronic contracts. The research method used was normative legal research with a systematic legal approach. The researchers used secondary data or legal materials obtained and processed using selective categorization. All of these legal materials were grouped based on criteria that was appropriate to the problems and issues, then analyzed descriptively and analytically. The law of khiyar al-majlis was described and analyzed through explanation, study, systematization, interpretation and evaluation. The results of this research showed that the existence of khiyar al-majlis in electronic contracts was only legal because the parties were not in the same transaction location as in conventional contracts. Then, the mechanism for implementing khiyar al-majlis could occur directly or indirectly in electronic contracts.

The decentralized nature of this technology prevents unauthorized access. This technology require the use of cryptocurrencies to be effectively utilized as a medium of exchange. While cryptocurrencies have received wide recognition as an improvement to modern business transactions. However, in the Muslim communities, Muslim scholars have divergent views on the permissibility and prohibition of cryptocurrencies on certain grounds. Islamic law is characterized by outstanding flexibility that enables it to keep pace with the development of time and place, and gives it the validity to interact to address emerging issues that stand in people's way. This study aims to examine blockhain smart contracts, how they work, the religious ruling surrounding its permissibility. As well as the consensus of Muslim Scholars on its usage by Muslim communities. The study adopts qualitative doctrinal, library based or normative judicial research to analyze blockchain smart contracts and their suitability and compatibility with Islamic law.

This predicament stems from the rapid surge in infrastructure expansion over the past twenty years, which has led to a surge in construction and demolition activities. Regrettably, there is currently no effective sustainable strategy to curtail the influx of concrete waste into these landfills. The implications of such landfill accumulation extend beyond just environmental concerns, encompassing human health, resource depletion, and harm to ecosystems. In response, this study embarked on a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to contrast the existing landfilling and transportation practices for concrete waste with a proposed recycling approach. Conducted within the framework of ISO 14040:2006, the LCA was meticulously structured, with the EcoInvent 3.4 database and SimaPro 8.5.2.0 software employed to streamline its various phases and outcomes. The research did not stop at the environmental realm; it delved into the financial aspect, utilizing the Handbook Environmental Prices 2017 to determine the damage costs associated with each impact. The comparison, rooted in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), demonstrated a stark contrast between the environmental ramifications of landfilling versus recycling and transportation. The findings underscored the profound environmental toll of concrete waste deposition in landfills compared to the recycling method and transport process. By unearthing the disparities in impact indicators and management techniques for concrete waste, this study paves the way for future investigations to pinpoint influential factors. It also suggests the potential for a forthcoming Life Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA) to supplement this analysis, unraveling the financial benefits of various concrete waste management strategies, and transcending mere damage costs. In essence, this study significantly enriches the comprehension of damage cost modeling and offers LCA insights into concrete waste management, encompassing divergent approaches like landfilling, recycling, and transportation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete Waste; Life Cycle Assessment; Life Cycle Cost; Recycling; Sustainability; Waste Management","","","","","Journal of Law and Emerging Technologies, (2022); Aboelazm, Karem Sayed, The constitutional framework for public policy in the Middle East and North Africa countries, International Journal of Public Law and Policy, 7, 3, pp. 187-203, (2021); Journal of Law and Sustainable Development, (2023); Kurdish Studies, (2024); Bovea, María D., Developments in life cycle assessment applied to evaluate the environmental performance of construction and demolition wastes, Waste Management, 50, pp. 151-172, (2016); Bravo, Miguel, Thermal performance of concrete with recycled aggregates from CDW plants, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 7, 7, (2017); Cheng, Jack C.P., A BIM-based system for demolition and renovation waste estimation and planning, Waste Management, 33, 6, pp. 1539-1551, (2013); Mahdian Dehkordi, Nima Mahdian, Distributed Robust Finite-Time Secondary Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 32, 5, pp. 3648-3659, (2017); Elchalakani, Mohamed F., Green concrete with high-volume fly ash and slag with recycled aggregate and recycled water to build future sustainable cities, Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 29, 2, (2017); Essam, Sayed, Dubai Municipality Initiative to Reduce Food Loss, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 9, (2022)","","Collegium Basilea","","","","","","22352074; 16606795","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193939677"

This issue motivated this study – (i) to investigate the effect of selected auditor characteristics in terms of specialization, tenure, and fee on GC opinion issuance and (ii) to examine the moderating effect of management’s, family’s, and institution’s influence on the relationship between auditor characteristics and GC opinion issuance. The study involves 644 Malaysian financially distressed listed companies in the period 2006 to 2012. The results of a panel logistic regression analysis show that auditor characteristics have no relationship with GC opinion issuance. Influential management - measured as the level of their ownership - can dampen the positive relationship between auditor specialization and auditor tenure with GC opinion issuance. The presence of an influential family, on the other hand, can strengthen the positive relationship between auditor tenure and GC opinion. No evidence about an influential institution’s impact on the GC opinion process could be found. In conclusion, while auditor characteristics do not affect the possibility of a GC opinion issuance, pressure imposed by influential management and family on the auditor during the audit opinion decision process does have an impact. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; financial literacy; investment; perceived trust; perceived usefulness; technology awarenessv","","","","","Ahmad, Maqsood, Overconfidence heuristic-driven bias in investment decision-making and performance: mediating effects of risk perception and moderating effects of financial literacy, Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, 38, 1, pp. 60-90, (2022); Ajzen, Icek, A Bayesian analysis of attribution processes, Psychological Bulletin, 82, 2, pp. 261-277, (1975); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); International Journal of Engineering Technology, (2018); International Journal of Advanced Computer Research, (2019); Albayati, Hayder, Accepting financial transactions using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency: A customer perspective approach, Technology in Society, 62, (2020); Almajali, Dmaithan Abdelkarim, Factors influencing the adoption of Cryptocurrency in Jordan: An application of the extended TRA model, Cogent Social Sciences, 8, 1, (2022); Alomari, Ali Saeed A., Factors influencing the behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency among Saudi Arabian public university students: Moderating role of financial literacy, Cogent Business and Management, 10, 1, (2023); Arias-Oliva, Mario, Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of factors influencing the use of cryptocurrencies in spanish households, Mathematics, 9, 4, pp. 1-19, (2021); Arias-Oliva, Mario, Variables influencing cryptocurrency use: A technology acceptance model in Spain, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, MAR, (2019)","","Universiti Putra Malaysia","","","","","","1823836X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193755435"

Design/methodology/approach: This was a quantitative study that targeted millennial banking service customers from an emerging market environment. The non-probability sampling approach was used, and the data were collected via a survey questionnaire. For data analysis, SPSS and SmartPLS Structural equation modeling were used. Findings/results: The results confirmed a direct relationship between privacy, invasiveness and usefulness perception. It also confirmed a direct relationship between perceived usefulness and the intention to accept mobile-marketed banking services. In addition, the results also showed that in addition to the direct impact of perceived usefulness on intention to adopt mobile marketing usage for banking services, it acts as a mediator variable. Practical implications: Academics can pursue a qualitative study to unpack the reasons for sensitivity around banking technology in emerging markets. The study should lead to better understanding of both the investigated market and others like it. Organisations will gain valuable insight for informed investment in such markets.

Its primary objectives are to elucidate how financial inclusion influences FDI and to examine the mediating role of economic growth and inflation as key factors. Key findings reveal a robust positive correlation between financial inclusion and FDI inflows within MENA countries. Specifically, the study uncovers significant relationships between FDI and the various dimensions of financial inclusion, including access, availability, and usage. This underscores the pivotal role of inclusive financial systems in attracting foreign investment. Moreover, the study highlights the symbiotic relationship between economic growth and FDI, indicating that heightened levels of economic prosperity attract greater investment. This underscores the importance of fostering conducive economic conditions to attract foreign capital. Furthermore, the study underscores the critical role of financial inclusion in shaping monetary policy and mitigating investment risks. By facilitating access to capital and reducing uncertainty, financial inclusion promotes transparency and stability, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of foreign markets for investment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial inclusion; foreign direct investment; GMM; MENA countries; panel data","","","","","Al-Okaily, Aws, Measuring success of accounting information system: Applying the delone and mclean model at the organizational level, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 98, 14, pp. 2697-2706, (2020); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., ORGANIZING EVENT UBIQUITOUS with A PROPOSED EVENT MOBILE APPLICATION in Bahrain, International Journal of Management, 11, 6, pp. 74-91, (2020); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., The Role of Industry 4.0 Technologies in Enabling Knowledge Management Practices: United Arab Emirates Perspective, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1999, pp. 145-156, (2024); Abu-AlSondos, Ibrahim A., An Ensemble Filter for Indoor Positioning Technology of Mobile Home Service with Agile iBeacon Deployment, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies, 17, 16, pp. 48-60, (2023); Al Omari, Rania Mohammad, The impact of profitability ratio on gross working capital of Jordanian industrial sector, International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research, 15, 26, pp. 421-428, (2017); Alshehadeh, Abdul Razzak, The impact of financial inclusion on bank performance: The case of Jordan, International Journal of Economics and Business Research, 20, 4, pp. 483-496, (2020); Al-Gasaymeh, Anwar S., Dynamic Model in Estimating the Impact of Competition on Banking Efficiency: Evidence form MENA Countries, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 193, pp. 385-394, (2023); Alghusin, Nawaf Salem, The impact of financial policy on economic growth in Jordan (2000-2017): An ardl approach, Ekonomski Pregled, 71, pp. 97-108, (2020); Alhawamdeh, Loai Naser, Do E-Service Quality and Digital Content Moderate the Relationship between Website Design and the Intention to visit the Museum?, Quality - Access to Success, 24, 194, pp. 143-150, (2023); Al-Khawaja, Haneen A., The COVID_19 Pandemic's Effects on Fintech in Banking Sector, Review of Economics and Finance, 21, 1, pp. 316-322, (2023)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18129358; 18104967","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192470595"

It also investigates the impact of digital banking transformation on customers’ financial behavior. Data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire and distributed to digital bank customers of ten banks in Indonesia. A total of 187 digital bank customers participated in this study. For data analysis, we employed Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using WarpPLS 6.0. The results show that customer communication, trust, transparency, and innovation positively affect digital banking transformation. It also indicates that the digital banking transformation positively impacts customer financial behavior. This study highlights previously unexplored aspects, particularly the role of digital banking transformation as a stimulant that encourages consumers to actively manage, plan, and invest their funds, which can significantly influence their financial decision-making behavior. The findings of this study highlight the importance of providing customers with a comprehensive understanding of the presence of digital banks. The advent of digital banks is expected to alter financial behaviors in the consumer decision-making process. Additionally, the government may safeguard and reassure individuals about the use of digital banking.

Our findings are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests and are still valid after using two-stage “shift-share” instrumental variable procedures, propensity score matching method and firm-level fixed effect regression to control for the endogeneity issue.

As a result, there is a growing need to incorporate sustainable frameworks into business decision-making. By focusing on sustainable performance at the firm level, we addressed a significant gap in understanding how environmental and social Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) impact bottom-line performance and the crucial role that effective country governance plays in implementing sustainability at the organization level. In 2015, the United Nations established Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where firms are encouraged to practice in the strategic operation of their businesses. In addition, country governance can play a significant role in adopting sustainable practices and policies that can impact bottom-line performance. In this study, we examined the relationship between environmental and social Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) practices, country governance, and firms’ financial performance from 2017 to 2021. The sample data set consisted of top-listed firms in the finance, manufacturing, and technology industries of 100 companies from 17 countries in developed and developing and emerging economies. We utilized content analysis to account for the qualitative aspects of how firms implement social and environmental SDGs. Ten environmental SDGs and eight social SDGs were incorporated in this study as a means of measuring sustainable development goals' impact on a firm’s financial performance. We adopted return on assets (ROA) to measure the firm’s financial performance. We adopted government effectiveness and regulatory quality to moderate the relationship between social and environmental sustainability practices and firm performance. The panel regression method was exercised to find out the relationship between environmental and social SDGs’ impact on financial performance. In addition, we measured the interaction effect between environmental and social SDGs and country governance on firms’ performance. We also deployed two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression estimation to mitigate endogeneity concerns. We found that environmental SDGs had a positive and significant impact on firms’ financial performance. The coefficient of social SDGs on firm performance was negative and statistically significant. We observed that the coefficient of interaction terms between environmental SDGs and country governance was positive and statistically significant. Moreover, the coefficient interaction terms between social SDGs and country governance were positive and statistically significant, lessening the negative impact of social SDGs on firm financial performance. Finally, we also performed a robustness test on our analysis based on the firm’s average capital and average assets. The findings almost held the same. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","country governance; environmental sustainable development goals; financial performance; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; social sustainable development goals","","","","","Acemoglu, Daron, The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation, American Economic Review, 91, 5, pp. 1369-1401, (2001); Aggarwal, Priyanka, CSR and sustainability reporting practices in India: an in-depth content analysis of top-listed companies, Social Responsibility Journal, 15, 8, pp. 1033-1053, (2019); J Econ Bus, (2018); Al Lawati, Hidaya, Does Sustainable Development Goals Disclosure Affect Corporate Financial Performance?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 13, (2022); Al Lawati, Hidaya, Disclosure quality vis-à-vis disclosure quantity: Does audit committee matter in Omani financial institutions?, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 57, 2, pp. 557-594, (2021); Albertini, Elisabeth, Does Environmental Management Improve Financial Performance?

While legitimacy of digital currency under Islamic law remains an open question, trading in digital currencies continues in the face of a host of different types of risks promoting the legislature to adopt the Law No. (4) of 2022 Regulating Digital Assets in the Emirate of Dubai. Based on the comparative analysis of legal and regulatory frameworks in the UAE, UK and USA, this article argues that the Emirate of Dubai has adopted a clear position on recognition of digital currencies and provided clear rules for mitigating the problems of assigning responsibility when companies authorised to practice in this field encounter speculations or become victims of criminal activities. This is a significant regulatory move at the time when many countries were reluctant to accept digital currencies and implement necessary regulatory frameworks for their usage.

They suffer from the ambiguity of contracts, and delays in reimbursement and do not feel the real impact of insurance in society. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative insurance based on blockchain and waqf. We suggest in this paper, to use smart contracts to create an efficient and automatic process in the collection of premiums and reimbursement of policyholders. The goal of this paper is to build insurance that reflects the true meaning of solidarity through Waqf while integrating transparency and speed through Fintech. This insurance model is supposed to be resilient in times of crisis, have a strong social impact, and be attractive to customers. Many advantages of the proposed model are discussed in the paper. In addition, the suggested insurance model will be represented through simulations on the NetLogo platform. We carry out the analysis in normal times and evaluate the behavior of policyholders in choosing a specific type of insurance, depending on some decision-making tools.

The findings show that attitude, awareness, and trust have significant and positive effects on Nigerian investors’ decision to invest in the Bitcoin market, while religious beliefs and awareness had significant impacts on investors’ level of trust in Bitcoin transactions. This implies that policymakers and relevant regulatory agencies should work on increasing public understanding and confidence by collaborating with key players in the financial sector and religious institutions in Nigeria.

The study employs a custom-designed questionnaire to investigate ESQ, customer trust, customer patronage, and respondents' personal information. The respondents are consumers from e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao, JD.com, and Tmall, totaling 130. The survey is conducted through social media platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, and QQ, and the respondents meet the criteria for using electronic services (e-services) and having a purchase intention. The survey results indicate that ESQ has a significant positive impact on customer trust. In particular, customers' trust in electronic commerce (EC) platforms increases with their perception of high-quality and reliable e-services. This trust further promotes customers' purchase intention. Specifically, when the level of advanced technology is high, the influence of ESQ on customer trust becomes more pronounced. This study concludes that ESQ substantially impacts both customer trust and patronage. Furthermore, advanced technology's moderating role emphasizes the significance of technological factors in the EC environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced technology; customer patronage; customer trust; electronic service quality (ESQ); modulating effect; purchase intention","Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Purchasing; Quality of service; Sales; Social sciences computing; Advanced technology; Commerce platforms; Customer patronage; Customer trust; Customers' satisfaction; Electronic service qualities; Modulating effect; Purchase intention; Social networking (online); Technological innovation","","","This work was supported by the Shanghai Planning of Philosophy and Social Science under Grant 2020BGL027.","International Journal of Innovation Creativity and Change, (2020); Alkraiji, Abdullah Ibrahim, The impact of service quality, trust and satisfaction on young citizen loyalty towards government e-services, Information Technology and People, 35, 4, pp. 1239-1270, (2022); Alzoubi, Haitham M., Investigating the impact of total quality management practices and Six Sigma processes to enhance the quality and reduce the cost of quality: the case of Dubai, International Journal of Business Excellence, 27, 1, pp. 94-109, (2022); Antony, Jiju, Benefits, challenges, critical success factors and motivations of Quality 4.0–A qualitative global study, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 34, 7-8, pp. 827-846, (2023); Antony, Jiju, Critical success factors for operational excellence initiatives in manufacturing: a meta-analysis, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 34, 9-10, pp. 1152-1172, (2023); Assefa, Dawit Z., Unpacking the negative impact of initial informality on innovation: The mediating roles of investments in R&D and employee training, Technovation, 114, (2022); Int J Oper Prod Manage, (2021); Bhati, Narender Singh Singh, Role of E-Service Quality (E-SQ) on Customers' Online Buying Intention: An Extended Theory of Planned Behavior, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 77337-77350, (2022); Brem, Alexander Michael, The AI Digital Revolution in Innovation: A Conceptual Framework of Artificial Intelligence Technologies for the Management of Innovation, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 70, 2, pp. 770-776, (2023); Chen, Lujie, The impact of governmental COVID-19 measures on manufacturers' stock market valuations: The role of labor intensity and operational slack, Journal of Operations Management, 69, 3, pp. 404-425, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15580040; 00189391","","IEEMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181574734"

This study examines the transformative potential of financial technology and sustainable financing in driving low-carbon energy transitions. It aims to achieve two objectives: first, to investigate the effectiveness of FinTech and sustainable financing in driving low-carbon energy transitions; and second, to probe the relationship between these mechanisms and the imperatives of biodiversity and sustainable natural resource utilization in the context of BRICS economies. Through the application of advanced econometric techniques such as fully modified OLS (FMOLS), dynamic OLS (DOLS), fixed effect-OLS (FE-OLS), and Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), this study investigates the impact of FinTech, sustainable financing, and biodiversity and natural resource utilization on low-carbon energy transitions. Our empirical findings underscore a robust, long-term co-integrating relationship among low-carbon energy advancement, financial technology, financial development, biodiversity preservation, and natural resource utilization. Notably, both FinTech innovations and accessible sustainable financing mechanisms positively influence the adoption of low-carbon energy practices. Moreover, economies rich in biodiversity and with higher income levels exhibit a strong inclination toward low-carbon energy sources. However, overreliance on natural resource extraction hampers the sustained adoption of low-carbon energy practices. This study recommends strategies that leverage FinTech and sustainable financing, while emphasizing the importance of safeguarding natural resources and promoting environmental management. These measures effectively address the energy crisis and foster policies and practices for low-carbon energy transitions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity preservation; Financial technology; Low-carbon energy transitions; Natural resource; Sustainable financing","Carbon; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Environmental management; Finance; Method of moments; Sustainable development; Biodiversity crisis; Biodiversity preservation; Energy crisis; Energy transitions; Financial technology; Fixed effects; Low carbon energies; Low-carbon energy transition; Natural resource utilization; Sustainable financing; Biodiversity; biodiversity; econometrics; empirical analysis; finance; natural resource; regression analysis; sustainability; technology adoption; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation; South Africa","","","Funding text 1: The authors present their appreciation to King Saud University for funding this research through Researchers Supporting Program number.; Funding text 2: The second author would like to thank Robert B.

Extending this discourse, Iqbal et al. (2021) examined data from 126 countries from 1971 to 2020. Using Panel FMOLS and DOLS, the study found that trade openness has detrimental effects on the environment in global, upper-middle, and low-income economies, contrasting with its benign influence in high-income economies. Meanwhile, urbanization contributes to environmental degradation across economies, except in low-income nations, where it fosters environmental improvement. In the case of the E7 countries, Bekun et al. (2021) investigated the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in emerging economies (China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, and Turkey) from 1995 to 2016. They found that these countries prioritize economic growth over environmental quality, validating the EKC phenomenon. In addition, renewable energy was crucial in reducing CO2 emissions, but weak institutions harmed the environment. Additionally, Bekun (2022) focused on India and discovered that renewable energy promotes sustainable development, negatively correlating with CO2 emissions. Non-renewables and real GDP growth had positive CO2 emission relationships. Quito et al. (2023) studied 43 European countries and found that renewable energy enhances energy efficiency.

Green bond issuance presents additional challenges, as the qualification of a bond as ‘green’, third-party verification is needed to guarantee that the proceeds fund environmentally beneficial projects. This implies additional administrative and compliance costs. Blockchain technology can address some of the issues mentioned above, to establish trust in impact reporting green bond processes. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled green bond issuance architecture that safeguards investors' confidence in the bond's green credentials while keeping the issuer from being accused of greenwashing. To adjust the process of bond issuance to a blockchain-enabled model, we tokenize the bonds. The digital token is created through a smart contract with a specific standard (in our case, ERC-20). Within the smart contracts developed, we use various functions to handle the prerequisites of validators and regulators' approval based on the documentation presented and the parameters of rate and maturity requested by the issuer. We use a separate smart contract to offer forensic-by-design services. The overall system also considers various regulatory compliance instruments and enhances the access of regulatory bodies to issuance records. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; digital tokens; green bond issuance; Securities issuance; smart contracts","","","","The views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Piraeus Bank.","Agliardi, Elettra, Financing environmentally-sustainable projects with green bonds, Environment and Development Economics, 24, 6, pp. 608-623, (2019); undefined, (2018); Beck, Roman, Governance in the blockchain economy: A framework and research agenda, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 19, 10, pp. 1020-1034, (2018); undefined, (2015); Benos, Evangelos, The Economics of Distributed Ledger Technology for Securities Settlement, Ledger, 4, pp. 121-156, (2019); Biswas, Baidyanath N., Analysis of barriers to implement blockchain in industry and service sectors, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 136, pp. 225-241, (2019); undefined, (2019); Busari, Saheed Abdullahi, Application of blockchain information technology in Ṣukūk trade, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 13, 1, pp. 1-15, (2021); undefined, (2016); Casino, Fran, A systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications: Current status, classification and open issues, Telematics and Informatics, 36, pp. 55-81, (2019)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","20430795; 20430809","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175612936"

To address these issues, blockchain technology emerges as a promising IT-based solution for achieving supply chain alignment. A conceptual model is developed based on the service-dominant logic theory that explores the impact of blockchain on supply chain alignment and co-created value outcomes within the Business-to-Business (B2B) construction context. Through a questionnaire-based approach, data were collected from 324 respondents in the global construction industry, which was then analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.

We find further evidence that this relationship is heterogeneous. Both state-owned and smaller banks, as measured by market capitalisation, are found to have presented a weaker response to Fintech development.

This study identifies the factors that affect the user's behaviour in the adaptability of blockchain technology (BT). The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with two additional factors comprising trust and transparency is used in the current study. The data of 240 respondents from the banks of Pakistan were tested through the PLS-SEM and fsQCA. The study results show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, trust in BT, transparency in BT and the facilitating condition positively affect, while social influence negatively affects the behavioural intention towards BT. This study extends the application of the UTAUT model with two dimensions (e.g., trust and transparency) to identify the factors that predict bankers' intentions and their subsequent effect on the overall use of blockchain-based remittance services in Pakistani banks. In addition, we extend this study by combining symmetric (i.e. PLS-SEM) and asymmetric (i.e. fsQCA) techniques to generate significant implications for banks that provide blockchain-based remittance services. The asymmetric findings also provided bankers with two models (recipes) that have a greater potential for predicting bankers' use of blockchain-based remittance services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain technology; effort expectancy; performance expectancy; social influence; transparency; trust","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Transparency; Banking sectors; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Effort expectancy; Empirical studies; Performance; Performance expectancy; Social influence; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Trust; Blockchain; adult; article; blockchain; empiricism; expectancy; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; Pakistan; theoretical study; trust","","","","Abbasi, Ghazanfar Ali, Asymmetrical modelling to understand purchase intention towards remanufactured products in the circular economy and a closed-loop supply chain: An empirical study in Malaysia, Journal of Cleaner Production, 359, (2022); Abbasi, Ghazanfar Ali, Let’s drive environmentally friendly: A perspective from asymmetrical modelling by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, Current Psychology, 42, 31, pp. 27275-27293, (2023); Abbasi, Amir Zaib, Using the playful consumption experience model to uncover behavioral intention to play Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games, Data Technologies and Applications, 56, 2, pp. 223-246, (2022); undefined, (2019); Ahmad, Sheraz, E-service quality and actual use of e-banking: Explanation through the Technology Acceptance Model, Information Development, 36, 4, pp. 503-519, (2020); Al-Emran, Mostafa, Determinants of Using AI-Based Chatbots for Knowledge Sharing: Evidence From PLS-SEM and Fuzzy Sets (fsQCA), IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 71, pp. 4985-4999, (2024); Abdallah Alalwan, Ali Abdallah, Factors influencing adoption of mobile banking by Jordanian bank customers: Extending UTAUT2 with trust, International Journal of Information Management, 37, 3, pp. 99-110, (2017); Abdallah Alalwan, Ali Abdallah, Examining factors influencing Jordanian customers’ intentions and adoption of internet banking: Extending UTAUT2 with risk, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 40, pp. 125-138, (2018); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2014)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","0144929X; 13623001","","BEITD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166418502"

To this end, we propose a novel PEM system based on blockchain technologies. In this PEM system, the evaluation data of products including evaluation scores and comments are stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS), and then the data hash addresses are returned and stored on the blockchain. Then, the retrieval of evaluation data is implemented by designing and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Since it is almost impossible to change any data stored in blockchain and IPFS, the proposed PEM system can protect the comment data from intentional or unintentional modifications. Moreover, the proposed PEM system allows users to efficiently and reliably retrieve the relevant evaluation data of a certain product by a given query keyword with the increase of data stored on the blockchain. In addition, to achieve high sustainability, the proposed system also contains an economic incentive mechanism, which is beneficial to form a virtuous circle in online shopping. The proposed system is simulated on the popular blockchain platform, i.e., Ethereum with Solidity programming language. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed PEM system achieves desirable usability, reliability, and sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; blockchain; e-commerce; interplanetary file system (IPFS); product evaluation management (PEM) system; smart contract","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Distributed computer systems; File organization; Information management; Peer to peer networks; Reliability analysis; Search engines; Sustainable development; Block-chain; Code; E- commerces; Filesystem; Interplanetary file system; Management systems; Peer-to-peer computing; Product evaluation; Product evaluation management system; Smart contract","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61972205, Grant 62032020, Grant 62122032, Grant U1836208, and Grant U1836110, in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1003205 and Grant 2018YFB1003702, in part by the Priority Academic Program Development of JiangsuHigher Education Institutions fund, in part by the Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology fund, and in part by the NUIST Students Platform for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program underGrant 202110300049.; Funding text 2: Manuscript received 18 July 2021; revised 21 October 2021, 17 November 2021, and 25 November 2021; accepted 25 November 2021.

AI technology such as machine learning, robo-advisors, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring have introduced significant efficiency to traditional finance. Nonetheless, its utilization in Islamic banking necessitates adherence to Shari’ah principles that forbid riba (interest), gharar (uncertainty), and maysir (speculative activities). This article argues for strengthening the ethical dimensions of AI by delineating frameworks for the responsible integration of AI into Islamic finance, promoting financial inclusiveness, and assuring compliance with the Shari’ah principles. The examination of the use of AI in risk management, fraud detection, and portfolio management within Shari’ah-compliant frameworks reveals how AI-driven solutions might conform to Islamic norms through transparency, equity, and social responsibility. Furthermore, the analysis of ethical dilemmas presented by AI’s potential lack of transparency and inherent biases, highlights the necessity for fairness-oriented models and regulatory modifications.

I-FinTech progressively asserts its role in various applications, including computer algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, robo-advisory, and social networks, to facilitate the development and advancement of digital Islamic finance. The adoption of I-FinTech has begun to enhance the benefits of Islamic social finance, particularly in the context of zakat. Zakat institutions have utilized technological advancements, including mobile devices and security technologies, to digitize their collection and distribution processes. Evidence suggests that zakat institutions can reduce operational costs, improve security, expedite payments, and facilitate better transactions by adopting finance technology. Despite significant advancements, the adoption of I-FinTech by zakat institutions encounter various challenges, including sharia compliance, financial inclusion, digital awareness, conservative culture, trust deficits, security concerns, infrastructure limitations, regulatory issues, and impact investment considerations. Limited research has explored the challenges faced by Islamic social finance in the adoption of FinTech. However, this study employs a qualitative approach, utilizing interviews with zakat managers, IT experts, and policymakers to assess the challenges and potential for I-FinTech adoption within zakat institutions. This research identifies significant challenges faced by zakat institutions, including insufficient technical knowledge and capabilities, traditional and conservative cultural influences, lack of awareness, and a deficit of talent and expertise in the full adoption of FinTech solutions.

Although zakat institutions in Malaysia use technology, confidence in the efficiency of the zakat fund is still an ongoing issue. Therefore, the potential of blockchain technology for improving the zakat management system is examined. Design/Methodology/Approach — An exploratory study involving two informants with expertise in blockchain technology and Islamic finance was conducted to investigate how the application of blockchain in the zakat management system will accelerate the future implementation and potential of zakat management in Malaysia. Findings — This research finds an accord between the features of blockchain technology and the objectives of zakat. The features are transparency, traceability and security, which align closely with the goals of zakat. As such, a new model has been proposed for the zakat management system, one empowered by blockchain technology that harmonises with the existing system and enhances these elements. Originality/Value — This research can motivate zakat institutions in Malaysia to implement blockchain technology in their zakat management systems by using the proposed model. The research shows the synchronisation of blockchain principles with zakat, which would build trust and confidence. Practical Implications — The discussion on how blockchain can be embedded in the existing zakat management system will contribute towards enhancing zakat management in Malaysia and improve the performance of zakat institutions, enabling them to better serve the community. Given the scarce literature on blockchain adoption in zakat management, this study can spur further research and discussion within this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain technology; Fintech; Islamic social finance; Zakat blockchain; Zakat management system","","","","This study is funded by the Ministry of Higher Education in Malaysia through the award of the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS): FRGS/1/2021/SS01/UKM/02/2.

The study also explored the role of blockchain technology in promoting transparency and the potential separation of blockchain from Bitcoin. The study found that cryptocurrencies are significantly impacted by political, economic, and regulatory factors. The study also found that it is challenging to control cryptocurrencies and cross-border transactions in the absence of accounting standards. The study recommends that regulators and accounting standards setters should establish new regulations and accounting standards for cryptocurrencies. Finally, this study identifies the vast majority of the existing literature as lacking adequate, well-rounded knowledge about cryptocurrencies or access to adequate resources, despite their clearly understanding the fundamental concepts of cryptocurrency.

The theoretical argument that has been developed thus far is that the fatwa is the most appropriate legal tool for Muslim communities to respond to the rapid development of digital business. Nevertheless, do the existing fatwas fulfill legal needs as expected in this era of digital transactions? Hence, this paper discusses digital transaction fatwas within the framework of Islamic legal epistemology, especially fatwas from the National Shariah Council– Indonesian Ulama Council. The research method uses normative juridical with a conceptual and historical-usuliyah approach. This research finds that the contemporary fatwa epistemology of the National Shariah Council–Indonesian Ulama Council in terms of digital transactions employs istislahi arguments. This is shown by the proposition that fiqh rules are more dominant than textual ones. Moreover, the arguments in the fatwa of the National Shariah Council–Indonesian Ulama Council provide signs of benefit as the estuary of maqasid syari’ah. The consistency of the use of legal methodology utilized by the National Shariah Council–Indonesian Ulama Council in fatwas on digital transactions is shown in the structure and utilization of al-nusus al-shariah arguments, the opinions of ulama, and the rules of fiqh, which are expanded from the five rules of fiqh into eight rules. These fatwas are reliable and valid in terms of dictum and method, thus supporting the development of the current digital transactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Transaction; Fatwa; Islamic Law Epistemology","","","","","Outlines of Muhammadan Law, (1974); Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Dynamic effect of Bitcoin, fintech and artificial intelligence stocks on eco-friendly assets, Islamic stocks and conventional financial markets: Another look using quantile-based approaches, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 192, (2023); Nukhbatul Ulum, (2016); Tahdis Jurnal Kajian Ilmu Al Hadis, (2022); Fatwa Fatwa Ekonomi Syariah, (2025); F Fatw Al Imm Al Shtib; Akbar, Yusaf H., The digital economy and the growth dynamics of sharing platforms: A transaction cost economics assessment, Journal of Digital Economy, 1, 3, pp. 209-226, (2022); Al-Zaman, Md Sayeed, Social mediatization of religion: islamic videos on YouTube, Heliyon, 8, 3, (2022); Usul Al Fiqh Al Islami; Alfarizi, Muhammad, Adoption Of Cash on Delivery (COD) Payment System in Shopee Marketplace Transaction, Procedia Computer Science, 227, pp. 110-118, (2023)","","Faculty of Sharia, Universitas Islam Negeri K.H.

The study used a qualitative approach to accomplish the research objectives. Semi-structured interviews with regulators, legal councils and investors were conducted to gain in-depth and practical knowledge concerning the connection among digital currencies, money laundering and customer protection. According to the study, Malaysia has positive intentions towards digital currencies concerning protection through robust legislation. However, current practices and laws enacted by the government and regulators are contradictory. It has resulted in confusion among the public concerning adopting or rejecting such currencies. Further, this confusion provided opportunities for scammers and caused the trapping of innocent investors by scammers. These loopholes and contradictions among different legislations offer a favourable environment for criminals, especially money launderers, to exploit the Malaysian digital currencies regime. Therefore, to address this situation and protect customers, authorities should clarify the roles of various regulators and educate the public about the dangers of using unauthorised digital currency platforms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customer protection; Digital Currencies; Money Laundering; Regulations","","","","","Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, (2021); International Journal of Advanced Computer Research, (2019); undefined, (2022); Luno Says Malaysia One of Its Strongest Market, (2022); Kepli, Mohd Yazid Bin Zul, Cryptocurrencies and anti-money laundering laws: The need for an integrated approach, pp. 247-263, (2019); Bowen, Glenn A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method, Qualitative Research Journal, 9, 2, pp. 27-40, (2009); Heres how Criminals Use Bitcoin to Launder Dirty Money, (2018); Crypto Adoption Steadies in South Asia Soars in the Southeast Chainalysis, (2022); Malaysia Ranks 7th in Cryptocurrency Ownership Out of 27 Countries, (2022); Malaysia Bans Initial Coin Offerings, (2020)","","Universiti Teknologi Mara","","","","","","26007975","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185493486"

However, most state-of-the-art cryptocurrency valuation methods only focus on one of the fundamental factors or sentiments and use out-of-date data sources. In this study, a robust cryptocurrency valuation method is developed using up-to-date datasets. Using various panel regression models and moving-window regression tests, the impacts of fundamental factors and sentiments in the valuation of cryptocurrencies are explored with data covering from January 1, 2009 to April 30, 2023. The research shows the importance of sentiments and suggests that the fear and greed index can indicate when to make a cryptocurrency investment, while Google search interest in cryptocurrency is crucial when choosing the appropriate type of cryptocurrency. Moreover, consensus mechanism and initial coin offering have significant effects on cryptocurrencies without stablecoins, while their impacts on cryptocurrencies with stablecoins are insignificant. Other fundamental factors, such as the type of supply and the presence of smart contracts, do not have a significant influence on cryptocurrency.

The analysis covers monthly data from January 1996 to February 2021. The research paper analyzes relative changes in the original time series through the autocorrelation function. The objects of this analysis are Amazon and Alibaba, as they are benchmarks in the e-commerce industry. This paper tests the shock effect on the e-commerce companies Alibaba in China and Amazon in the USA, concluding that it is weaker for companies with small market capitalizations. As a result, the effect on estimated e-trade volume in the USA was approximately 35% in 2020. Another evaluation considers fuzzy decision-making methodology. For this purpose, balanced scorecard-based open financial innovation models for the e-commerce industry are weighted with multistepwise weight assessment ratio analysis based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets and the golden cut. Within this framework, a detailed analysis of competitors should be made.

The halal status of food must be traced from the process of raw materials, processing, packaging, transportation, and distribution to the final consumer. It is difficult to trace the certainty of halal food, especially beef in Medan City because the supply chain information from upstream to downstream is not transparent. To increase the transparency of beef status and increase consumer confidence, especially Muslim consumers, a distributed and transparent system is needed, where many parties can access the status of food at any time. So Blockchain technology is used to help track the halal status of beef along the supply chain. The purpose of this study is to design a system to obtain information certainty that beef distributed along the supply chain is halal and safe for consumption by utilizing Blockchain technology and to increase public safety and trust in the LPPOM MUI halal certification system. Based on the discussion and research analysis, it is known that the information in the halal beef supply chain in Medan City uses blockchain technology designed with a data security system using smart contracts, where information that has been stored cannot be changed by any party. so that there is a guarantee of information security in the beef supply chain in the city of Medan.

Design/methodology/approach: This type of research is legal research, adopting the statute approach, comparative approach, and conceptual approach. The focus of the study is Indonesia with comparative studies with Malaysia and the United Kingdom. Findings: Malaysia, Indonesia, and the United Kingdom are all on the top five countries in the Global Islamic Fintech (GIFT) Index. The list comprises countries that are most conducive to the growth of the Islamic Fintech market and ecosystem. However, weak supervision and low Sharia compliance are still becoming prominent challenges in the implementation of Islamic Fintech, while Sharia compliance is the core principle for Islamic finance regulation. Another finding is that a good ecosystem of Islamic Fintechs needs supportive regulations and policies, a Sharia Supervisory Board, and standards of Islamic Fintech Shariah governance. Research limitations/implications: This study examines the regulation and supervision of Islamic Fintech in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom countries whose Islamic Fintech industry is growing rapidly. Practical implications: This study is a strong reference for countries with potential Islamic finance, especially when they are constructing the Sharia compliance regulations to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the Islamic finance industries. Social implications: Sharia compliance regulations can be a subsystem in the Islamic financial ecosystem to encourage Sharia economic growth in various countries. Originality/value: To ensure Sharia compliance, it is recommended to take some steps: (a) creating the Sharia compliance regulations; (b) creating the Sharia supervisory boards; and (c) standardizing the Sharia governance of Islamic Fintech. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic finance; Regulations; Sharia compliance","","","","","Islamic Finance and Markets Review Bahrain, (2020); Ahmed, Selim, The impact of Islamic Shariah compliance on customer satisfaction in Islamic banking services: mediating role of service quality, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 13, 9, pp. 1829-1842, (2022); AlAbbad, Amal, Can Shariah board characteristics influence risk-taking behavior of Islamic banks?, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 12, 4, pp. 469-488, (2019); Comsats Journal of Islamic Finance, (2019); Ali, Muhammad, How perceived risk, benefit and trust determine user Fintech adoption: a new dimension for Islamic finance, Foresight, 23, 4, pp. 403-420, (2021); 3rd University Research Colloquium Urecol 2016, (2016); Islamic Finance the Regulatory Challenge, (2007); de Anca, Celia, Fintech in Islamic finance: From collaborative finance to community-based finance, pp. 47-65, (2018); State of the Global Islamic Economy Report, (2025); Global Islamic Fintech Report, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","13590790; 17587239","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131177509"

This study raised essential questions: what is the perception of ICF in the Middle East? Does the Middle East region really need an Islamic crowdfunding model to support SMEs? Is it possible to create a crowdfunding platform complaint with Sharia? What are the requirements for developing an Islamic crowdfunding model? Design/methodology/approach: The methodology followed to answer these questions is a qualitative research design depends on in-depth interviews, literature review, historical analysis and critical discussion. Data analysis was conducted using NVivo to analyze 25 in-depth interviews with Islamic scholars, Sharia board members and Islamic finance experts from different Middle East countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Iraq, UAE and Bahrain. In addition, more than 115 transcriptions, memos and research articles were used. Findings: The study provides a new Islamic Sharīʿah-compliant crowdfunding model as the main outcome of this study. In addition, the content analysis revealed four main themes to be the essential pillars to develop the ICF model. These provisions of Islamic Sharia are: Project Idea (Halal) (28.5%), Funding Goal (36%), Return and Risk (14%) and Funding Commitments (21.5%). The findings also revealed that the four types of crowdfunding (reward-based crowdfunding, donation-based crowdfunding, loan-based crowdfunding and equity-based crowdfunding) are legal and supported by evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Originality/value: Despite the critical development in Islamic finance and the expanding number of young Muslims slanting digital Islamic services, empirical studies exploring this issue in the Middle East is still inadequate. Further, ICF has increased attention and there is an urgent need for financing new SMEs in the Middle East. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowdfunding; Fintech; Fintech; Islamic crowdfunding model; Islamic finance; Middle East; NVivo; SMEs","","","","Advance orders: crowdfunding platforms allow contributors to receive a product or service at a lower price than the retail price.

Within the banking sector, Islamic banks assume a significant role in advocating ethical and socially responsible conduct. This study delves into the impact of the board of directors' characteristics on corporate social responsibility disclosures (CSRD) within Jordanian Islamic banks. Data were meticulously gathered from three Jordanian Islamic banks, all of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), over the span of the years 2010 to 2022. Our findings illuminate that Jordanian Islamic banks, on average, disclose 47 percent of their CSR endeavors, marking a commendable level of transparency, particularly when contrasted with less developed economies. Notably, independent directors comprise 42% of the board composition, with the average age of board members standing at 41 years. Moreover, 8.10% of board members hold degrees in finance and accounting, while 0.24% possess professional experience within the Big Four accounting firms. On average, Jordanian Islamic banks convene 10.27 board meetings annually, and 48% of directors maintain multiple directorships. Significantly, our analysis underscores that all examined characteristics of board members have a favorable influence on CSR disclosure within Jordanian Islamic banks. This paper constitutes a substantial contribution to the extant literature by providing empirical substantiation of the nexus between the board of directors' characteristics and CSRD in Jordanian Islamic banks, with a specific emphasis on the unique domain of Islamic banking, which has hitherto received limited scholarly attention. Further avenues of research are recommended to explore additional variables and delve deeper into the intricate interplay between board characteristics, external contextual factors, and the disclosure of CSR activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board of directors; Corporate social responsibility; disclosures; Ethical practices; Islamic banks; Jordanian banking sector; Transparency","","","","","Journal of Modern Accounting and Auditing, (2017); Aksenov, Gleb, Development of Trade and Financial-Economical Relationships between China and Russia: A Study Based on the Trade Gravity Model, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 7, (2023); Alawaqleh, Qasim Ahmad, The Effect of Board of Directors and CEO on Audit Quality: Evidence from Listed Manufacturing Firms in Jordan, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 2, pp. 243-253, (2021); Alfraih, Mishari M., Voluntary disclosure and corporate governance: empirical evidence from Kuwait, International Journal of Law and Management, 59, 2, pp. 217-236, (2017); AlQudah, Alaa Mohammad, The role of ownership map in constraining discretionary loan loss-provisions decisions in Jordanian banks, Cogent Business and Management, 7, 1, (2020); Alrabba, Hussein Mohammed, The mediating role of foreign ownership in the relationship between board characteristics and voluntary disclosures of Jordanian banks, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, 22, 6, (2018); International Journal of Management and Applied Science, (2018); Al-Zaqeba, Murad Ali Ahmad, Extension of the TPB in tax compliance behavior: The role of moral intensity and customs tax, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 4, pp. 227-232, (2020); Al-Zaqeba, Murad Ali Ahmad, The effect of management accounting and blockchain technology characteristics on supply chains efficiency, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 10, 3, pp. 973-982, (2022); Alzaqebah, Malek, Hybrid feature selection method based on particle swarm optimization and adaptive local search method, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 2414-2422, (2021)","","Institute of Advanced Science Extension (IASE)","","","","","","2313626X; 23133724","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182372436"

Design/methodology/approach: This study empirically examined the beliefs and expectations on the proposed WIIGM model, which was adapted from the theory of reasoned action (TRA). Data was collected from 366 respondents selected via convenience sampling. Questionnaires were distributed online, of which responses were then analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling for hypothesis testing. Ethical approval is also gathered before the data collection begins. Findings: This study found that collaboration for investment and governance significantly contribute to sustainable income generation in waqf operations and management, which eventually results in the community’s trust and acceptance of the WIIGM model. Technology advancement also significantly influences sustainable income generation, which finally leads to the community's behavioural intention to participate in the WIIGIM model. Further studies on this variable may establish findings from other perspectives. Practical implications: This paper is an original study that empirically examines the potential for a new waqf integrated income-generating model in building the trust of the community towards waqf institutions. This study is significantly important for practitioners and policymakers in evaluating the potential roles of waqf based on the belief and trust of the community.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a historical approach, we set out to discuss the systematic use of “folk contract” as a tool of tracing accountability in timber trading and in the collective management of community forests in this region, based on the archives of Qingshui River Manuscripts. Findings: The findings indicate that active transactions of small forest plots facilitated by the prevalent use of folk contracts allow both the landlords and the tenants to easily acquire cashflow needed any time before the harvest, and in turn prevent premature logging and deforestation for crop farming. An “open ledger” bookkeeping system emerged from the extensive contracting practices guarantees the functioning of a dualistic accountability system, where both market value of timbers and “face” value of community members' reputation are preserved for long-term sustainability of local economy, society and ecological environment.

London and Luxembourg host far more banks than can be explained by their national gross domestic product, which can be traced back to their export of banking services. We also analyze the geographies of specialized banking services per city. Corporate and investment banking are mainly explained by national gross domestic product, with London emerging as the most prominent center.

The underlying ethos of AI is to create a secure ecosystem for every human endeavour. Investors are claiming that the invention of an AI assistant such as a robot maid is the future reality. The AI robot is unstoppable and will obstruct how things are done at home. The development of AI and the demand for it indicates a future challenge to domestic activities. Since technology is replacing human efforts, scholars and researchers are concerned about the permissibility of Islamic banks to finance AI projects for the development of robot-maid. A robot maid is likely to exploit gender issues simply because consumers might prefer an AI maid that is male or female. Social violation in the use of AI maid will likely trigger further queries. This study uses the doctrinal approach of the qualitative method to explore Islamic thresholds and analyzes the juristic consideration for financing the development of AI for human development. The study explains the understanding of AI, its contributions to the world economy, and some pertinent issues and challenges. This study found that the growth of AI interventions in homes and care services is a reality, but financing AI maids requires adherence to Islamic requirements, including Shariah compliance and consideration of ethical, economic, security, and social concerns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; Financing; Robot-maid; Shariah","","","","","Abbas, Kausar, Wıll Artıfıcıal Intellıgence Rejuvenate Islamıc Fınance?

This digital-based approach is one of the outputs of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which transformed the path of human history and resulted in the development of digital transformation strategy innovation, more commonly referred to as digitalisation. Previous literature has predicted that integrating fintech into waqf management will facilitate fintech's growth and expand waqf outreach in Malaysia. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the impact of “Industry 4.0” on the expansion of fintech into cash waqf in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovation (DOI) model. In addition, a quantitative approach based on structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the relationship between awareness, knowledge, relative advantage, social norms, perceived trust and fintech adoption in waqf institutions by using the tool Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) version 23.0 with maximum likelihood estimation. Findings: The overall indicate that perceived trust and social norms significantly influence the adoption of fintech by Malaysian waqf. At the same time, other factors such as awareness, relative advantage and knowledge do not appear to significantly influence the adoption of fintech amongst Malaysian waqf institutions. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes significantly to the current literature concerning the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the wave of technologies. In addition, this study supports relevant theories, including DOI and other technology adoption theories. Aside from this, the study provides empirical contributions to waqf management regarding collecting and distributing waqf, improving the level of regulation of the waqf institutions and enhancing trust between donors, waqf management and beneficiaries. This study is amongst the first in the area of waqf that focus on Malaysian waqf intitutions. Originality/value: This is important for policy development to support the utilisation of fintech for waqf institutions, which leads to more transparency and efficiency.

Findings: Taking advantage of Malaysia’s comprehensive Shariah Governance Framework for IBs, the study highlighted the importance of SBs to better address the opportunities and challenges of financial innovation for the development of IBs with the inclusion of FinTech. The authors found that digital solutions and tools, such as Robo Advisory system and blockchain, enhance SBs’ roles by providing more effective and timely Shariah assurance regardless of the volume of data information and storage.

In this regard, this study aims to examine the relationship between the digital economy, as measured by four proxies (infrastructure, empowerment of society, technological economic growth and digitalisation development), and the productivity and monetary system of Oman from 1985 to 2019. Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive distributed lag methodology and diagnostic tests were used to increase the robustness of findings. Findings: The analysis showed significant positive long-run relationships between infrastructure (measured as the number of fixed telephone subscriptions), technological economic growth (measured as medium- and high-tech exports as a percentage of manufactured exports) and the monetary system. There was also a significant negative short-run relationship between digitalisation development, measured as the number of individuals (percentage of the population) using the internet, and the monetary system. Furthermore, there were significant positive short- and long-run relationships between digitalisation development and productivity. Only short-run relationships were identified between empowerment of society, measured as the number of mobile cellular subscriptions, and productivity. Originality/value: The conclusions support the paradigm of diffusion of innovation theory, which aims to understand the use of modern technologies to obtain the maximum economic benefit, and show both the dark and bright sides of technology. Furthermore, the effect of the digitalisation economy paradigm on productivity should be determined by increasing logistical services. This will support the growth of foreign and domestic investments and promote cooperation between the public and private sectors, thereby achieving digitalisation in Oman and enabling reflection on the country’s monetary policy development and economic growth. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ARDL model; Diffusion of innovation theory; Digital economy paradigm; Monetary system; Productivity","","","","Availability of data and material : Source of data sets are available in World Bank Indicators from 2004 to 2019, at the link https://data.worldbank.org/ Ethical standard : The authors declare that this research paper complies with the ethical standards of this journal.

The accuracy of financial reporting and the ability of the Nigerian banks to fully digitalize their services are both severely limited by infrastructure deficiencies and unstable power supplies. The goal of this study is to fill in the gaps in the existing literature on the significance of digital disruption of accounting information in DMBs in Nigeria's developing banking industry. The study employed a field survey research design and data were sourced with the help of self-structured questionnaires. The respondents were drawn from the staff of 13 DMBs listed in Nigeria. A total of 641 questionnaires were retrieved and validated for the study. The reliability and validity of the study instruments were confirmed with the help of the Cronbach alpha test with a range of 0.877 to 0.967 which suggested satisfactory reliability of the measures and further suggested that all the measurement scales of the instrument were good enough. The results showed that the mean values for each category ranged from 3.83 to 4.53 with an overall mean of 4.13. The regression showed that DDAI had a significant effect on qualitative characteristics. The study concluded that DDAI had a significant effect on the quality of the financial reporting of listed DMBs in Nigeria.

The study's population included 210 service-based enterprises located in Jordan. The research used a sample size of 136 respondents from registered service-based enterprises in Jordan. The researchers used a structured questionnaire to gather data from the participants. The data acquired in this study were evaluated using a combination of basic percentage calculations and Pearson product moment analysis. The research has reached the conclusion that the lending activities of Fintech firms have a noteworthy impact on the expansion of service-based companies in Jordan. The study suggests that it would be advantageous for the Fintech service provider to engage in advertising efforts aimed at promoting their services, with the goal of increasing the adoption of their mobile money product among a wider range of business professionals. This would lead to an increased number of entrepreneurs using Fintech as a means to augment the expansion of their businesses. The scope of the research was limited to a small number of service-based organizations. However, it is important to include other service-based companies that were not included in this study. To get a comprehensive understanding, a comparison study should be conducted to explore other characteristics that were not addressed in the current research.

This study aims to integrate Fintech with value chain in existing system of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) and to determine the adoption of Fintech value chain financing (FVCF) by IFIs in the presence of mediators. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines a conceptual model by performing a self-administration survey for 393 sample size. After the completion of data collection 263 suitable responses are used for analysis. The hypotheses are tested by applying algorithm, bootstrapping and blindfolding techniques. Findings: The findings of structural model demonstrate that trust, information sharing (IS) and information and communication technology (ICT) are important for adoption of FVCF in the perspective of IFIs. Secondly, innovativeness is partially mediating the relationship of trust, IS and ICT for adoption of FVCF. Thirdly, competitiveness is fully mediating the relationship of trust, IS and ICT with agility for adoption of FVCF by IFIs. Research limitations/implications: Theoretically, this research is developing a conceptual model that is providing a new way to integrate value chain partners. This study is demonstrating the sequential mediation for the adoption of FVCF. Practically, this research is giving meaningful insight to policymakers of IFIs by suggesting a way forward to adopt FVCF. However, there is need to know the perception of other stakeholders that may involve in FVCF.

It follows the categorization of Imerman and Fabozzi, Lee and Shin, and Reiners for FinTech and credit platforms. In addition, this study follows the perceived risk classifications of Abramova and Bohme, Featherman and Pavlou, and Ryu. The significance of this study stems from the need for a comprehensive analysis of all FinTech credit platform types, their problems, and the gaps in the existing literature to guide future research. Therefore, this study focuses on the vertical business models of FinTech and its credit platforms. In doing so, it clarifies the relationships between perceived risk facets that could impact FinTech credit platforms, identifies the causes of perceived risks, and compiles all proposed solutions to mitigate perceived risks from previous studies. In addition, the format and methodology of this study adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) declaration, which includes four phases and a checklist of twenty-seven items. Using thirteen keywords, 1147 publications were collected from the Scopus database, from which 123 papers fitted the PRISMA procedure employed for this study. This survey determined peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding platforms to be the most popular platforms. Financial, operational, legal, security, and overall risks were determined to be the five most prominent aspects of perceived risk. The default risk factor appeared as the largest contributor to financial and other interrelated hazards among the risk factors. Thus, this work makes several significant contributions. It aids regulators in formulating laws and policies to manage, monitor, and control the FinTech industry. It provides useful insight to lenders and investors, particularly in assisting them to obtain clearer feasibility for investment into such platforms by defining potential perceived risks and their factors. In conclusion, it guides scholars in the pursuit of future investigations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit; Crowdfunding; FinTech; Peer-to-Peer; Perceived risk; Platforms","","","","","Abramova, Svetlana, Perceived benefit and risk as multidimensional determinants of bitcoin use: A quantitative exploratory study, (2016); Ahelegbey, Daniel Felix, Latent factor models for credit scoring in P2P systems, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 522, pp. 112-121, (2019); Ali, Muhammad, How perceived risk, benefit and trust determine user Fintech adoption: a new dimension for Islamic finance, Foresight, 23, 4, pp. 403-420, (2021); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2021); Au, Cheuk Hang, Developing a P2P lending platform: stages, strategies and platform configurations, Internet Research, 30, 4, pp. 1229-1249, (2020); Bardsley, Peter, Competing lending platforms, endogenous reputation, and fragility in microcredit markets, European Economic Review, 112, pp. 107-126, (2019); Behl, Abhishek, Enabling artificial intelligence on a donation-based crowdfunding platform: a theoretical approach, Annals of Operations Research, 319, 1, pp. 761-789, (2022); Belavina, Elena, Rethinking crowdfunding platform design: mechanisms to deter misconduct and improve efficiency, Management Science, 66, 11, pp. 4980-4997, (2020); Fintech Credit Market Structure Business Models and Financial Stability Implications, (2017); Bonini, Stefano, The role of venture capital in the emerging entrepreneurial finance ecosystem: future threats and opportunities, Venture Capital, 21, 2-3, pp. 137-175, (2019)","","Social Sciences Research Society","","","","","","13098055","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162110902"

This phenomenon has generated a significant number of digital assets left behind after the demise of their owners. This paper provides a legal analysis of the implications of abandoned digital assets in Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms. It seeks answers to two central research questions: what are the Sharīʿah and legal implications of digital assets after the passing of the owner? How can the existing Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms prevent uncertainty over digital assets? Design/Methodology/Approach — This is a conceptual paper which adopts a qualitative analysis of both primary and secondary sources from existing journals and regulatory instruments in Islamic finance jurisdictions to explore the gaps in the law regarding digital assets and regulations regarding unclaimed money. The paper further compares the approaches adopted in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia in regulating digital assets and unclaimed moneys. Findings — The paper finds that there is scope for the administration of digital assets in both regulated and unregulated Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms. Similarly, the adoption of e-KYC that complies with the Sharīʿah ethos is essential to ensure that digital assets are not lost upon the account holder’s demise. The legal right and title of the account holder and legal heirs can only be protected through the operation of digital assets regulation in a Sharīʿah-compliant fintech environment. Originality — This paper is of value to administrators and legal heirs of account holders in fintech environments. It recommends measures to prevent intestacy and uphold the account holders’ and legal heirs’ intergenerational property rights and financial benefits. Research Limitations/Implications — As a conceptual paper, the attitude of digital asset users is not examined due to the absence of quantitative or qualitative data on devolution of digital assets. Practical Implications — Although this study focuses on the implication of digital assets for Sharīʿah-compliant fintech platforms, the findings may well have a bearing on policymakers, legal practitioners, and administrators of estates in the management of emerging asset classes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital assets; Fintech; Securities; Sharīʿah; Unclaimed money","","","","","Abiteboul, Serge, Viewpoint : Managing your digital life, Communications of the ACM, 58, 5, pp. 32-35, (2015); Islamic Culture Al Thaqfat Al Islmiyyah Research Journal, (2010); Sjd Thesis Unclaimed Money in Saudi Banks, (2016); Ante, Lennart, The impact of transparent money flows: Effects of stablecoin transfers on the returns and trading volume of Bitcoin, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 170, (2021); International Conference on Sociality and Economics Development Ipedr, (2011); Academic Journal of Business Administration Law and Social Sciences, (2015); Understanding Islamic Law, (2011); Prob Prop Heinonline, (2015); Sahih Bukhari, (1956); Does My Digital Estate Belong to Me Estate Planning for Digital Assets, (2013)","","International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA)","","","","","","22894365; 01281976","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165695422"

The primary distinction between conventional and Islamic finance is that Sharia law explicitly forbids several of the activities and principles applied in conventional banking. According to Sharia law, “Paying or charging an interest (Riba)” lending with interest payments as an exploitative practice that benefits the lender at the expense of the borrower, “investing in businesses engaged in banned activities"" like producing and selling alcohol or pork, “speculation or gambling(Maisir)” That means financial institutions are prohibited from participating in contracts where the ownership of goods depends on an unpredictable future event, and Participation in contracts with a high level of risk or uncertainty is referred to as ""uncertainty and risk (Gharar)"", which are strictly prohibited. As a result, consumers must be aware of whether they are taking Riba, Gharar, Maisir or if their money is invested in a halal firm. Because of its qualities, blockchain would be useful in this situation. This research tries to determine how blockchain technology can be used to make investments and profit or loss returns more transparent, more secure, Immutable and sharia compliant.

This study argues that disaster risk management (DRM) is an essential approach to mitigate the impact of global calamities, such as a pandemic. However, due to the uncertainty emerging from variables such as time and demand, managing DRM effectively involves high complexity. Blockchain technology (BcT) can be implemented to help address these challenges due to its potential to build trust, transparency, and accountability in complex operations. However, no research has quantitatively examined the applicability of BcT in the sub-dimensions of DRM to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal and scope of this study is to explore the role of BcT in DRM operations during the COVID-19 pandemic through an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (IF-MCDM) framework. More specifically, the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (IF-ANP) method was utilized to calculate the weights of key criteria (i.e., BcT benefits), while Intuitionistic Fuzzy VIKOR (IF-VIKOR) was used to prioritize the alternatives (i.e., the sub-dimensions of DRM). The findings of this study are threefold. First, supporting effective coordination turned out to be the most essential benefit of BcT to build resilience in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, disaster management was found to be the most appropriate DRM sub-dimension for possible BcT implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, eleven distinct activities involved in disaster management and governance and financial protection were discovered to be the most applicable for BcT. The findings of this study could assist disaster risk managers to assess whether (or not) BcT is suitable for the sub-dimensions of DRM to build national and organizational resilience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain technology; Disaster risk management; Intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision making; The COVID-19","","","","","Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A., Blockchain technologies to mitigate COVID-19 challenges: A scoping review, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine Update, 1, (2021); Abdullah, Mohd Lazim, Sustainable energy planning decision using the intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process: choosing energy technology in Malaysia, International Journal of Sustainable Energy, 35, 4, pp. 360-377, (2016); Abid, Amal, NovidChain: Blockchain-based privacy-preserving platform for COVID-19 test/vaccine certificates, Software - Practice and Experience, 52, 4, pp. 841-867, (2022); Ahmed, Wafaa A.H., Blockchain in the supply chain – A comprehensive framework for theory-driven research, Digital Business, 2, 2, (2022); Aitzhan, Nurzhan Zhumabekuly, Security and Privacy in Decentralized Energy Trading Through Multi-Signatures, Blockchain and Anonymous Messaging Streams, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 15, 5, pp. 840-852, (2018); AlShamsi, Mohammed, Artificial intelligence and blockchain for transparency in governance, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 912, pp. 219-230, (2021); Ar, Ilker Murat, Evaluating the feasibility of blockchain in logistics operations: A decision framework, Expert Systems with Applications, 158, (2020); Asadzadeh, Afsoon, Information technology in emergency management of COVID-19 outbreak, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 21, (2020); Atanassov, Krassimir T., Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 20, 1, pp. 87-96, (1986); undefined, (2008)","","Springer","","","","","","19369743; 19369735","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145231259"

By using trustworthy, secured transparent ledgers, smart contracts and decentralized platforms, the efficiency, security, and accessibility of food crop agri-insurance for farmers can be prominently enhanced. By tracking food crop provenance, blockchain aids in the establishment of reliable crop insurance and confidence between farmers and insurance company. Traditional crop insurance schemes are complicated and often unprofitable. Because of the lack of confidence in insurance companies and a concern over deferred and any non-payment of claims, farmers frequently express reluctance to have their crops insured. This paper provides an outline for the potential benefits of using blockchain technology in food crop agri-insurance and proposes the implementation that can automate the claim process, reduce the time and work needed to process claims and make the process faster and more efficient for farmers. It can also increase transparency and reduce the risk of fraud, which improves the overall security of the system.

Design/methodology/approach: This work combines data analytics of text mining with qualitative analysis of human intelligence in two steps. First, knowledge discovery of the Islamic fintech ecosystem’s core elements using a sample of eight academic articles totalling 102 pages and 75,082 words. Second, using the identified core elements from step one to explore such ecosystem development in Indonesia. This stage employs a sample of 11 documents totalling 371 pages and 143,032 words from cyberspace. Findings: The core elements of the Islamic fintech ecosystem identified are financial customers, fintech startups, government, technology developers, traditional financial institutions and fatwa (Islamic legal opinion). Furthermore, the development of the Islamic fintech ecosystem in Indonesia is examined under these identified core elements, providing critical insights into the Islamic fintech ecosystem currently established in the country's industry. Research limitations/implications: This study primarily used semi-structured data from cyberspace. Traditional approaches to qualitative data collection, e.g. focused group discussions and interviews, may be beneficial for future studies in addressing the Islamic fintech ecosystem issues. Practical implications: Academia worldwide may benefit from this work in incorporating knowledge of Islamic fintech ecosystem’s core elements into Islamic finance literature. Specifically, fintech stakeholders in Indonesia may be advantaged to understand how far the Islamic fintech ecosystem has grown in the country. Social implications: The rise of unethical fintech peer-to-peer lending shows social problems in Indonesia’s fintech industry. The finding derives social implications that elucidate the current state of the country’s Islamic fintech ecosystem.

It is important to explore the challenges as extant literature provides limited guidelines about this issue.

The sample included senior managers of foreign bank branches working in the Saudi market by the end of 2019. The quantitative data were analyzed using the distribution fitting algorithmic approach, and it is supported by the qualitative data analyzed using the thematic analysis method.

News coverages may serve as either signals or noise in cryptocurrency markets characterized by an insufficient understanding of the fundamental value of assets and a high level of strategic complementarity. In a game-theoretic model, we show that the number of news coverages, either related or unrelated to the fundamentals, increases the price volatility of assets in a nascent financial market. We tested our hypotheses using a unique dataset of 358,118 observations of 500 cryptocurrencies and 36,572 media coverages between 2014 and 2017, the early period of cryptocurrency with the rise of public attention. The results show that cryptocurrency price volatility increases in the number of unrelated news for both major and minor coins. The volatility even increases with the number of related news in minor coins.

This concept is a model of empowering economic digitalization within the scope of government to provide facilities and the synchronization of all stakeholders throughout the archipelago (). In addition, the ease of the financial use of technology as part of economic digitalization can provide flexibility in SME financial transactions that enable the development of an efficient and effective business order. Various circumstances influence SMES in adopting Islamic economic digitalization such as knowledge about Islamic economy, perceptions, expectations, social responsibility aspects, facilities and Islamic values. The business continuity of Islamic SMEs is strongly supported by the adoption of Islamic fintech and financial literacy (; ; ). Some attributes can be attached to digital economics, such as digitalization, namely business transactions using information and technology devices; virtualization, namely changing business mechanisms from physical goods to virtual goods; molecularization, namely the status of heavy organizations changing into light organizations that are more flexible; internetworking, which can help in building interconnections and forming economic networks; disintermediation, i.e., eliminated peer-to-peer ().","Abbass, Kashif, Fresh Insight through a Keynesian Theory Approach to Investigate the Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 3, (2022); Abdallah, Ali, Has the Lack of a Unified Halal Standard Led to a Rise in Organised Crime in the Halal Certification Sector?, Forensic Sciences, 1, 3, pp. 181-193, (2021); Akben Selcuk, Elif, Corporate social responsibility and financial performance: The moderating role of ownership concentration in Turkey, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 13, (2019); Alamsyah, Andry, Blockchain-Based Traceability System to Support the Indonesian Halal Supply Chain Ecosystem, Economies, 10, 6, (2022); Albaity, Mohamed Shikh Abubaker, Bank Stock Return Reactions to the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Investor Sentiment in MENA Countries, Risks, 10, 2, (2022); Alhammadi, Salah, Analyzing the Role of Islamic Finance in Kuwait Regarding Sustainable Economic Development in COVID-19 Era, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2022); Growing Indonesias Sharia Economy Requires Focus on Four Energy Pillars, (2021); Arner, Douglas W., Sustainability, FinTech and Financial Inclusion, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 1, pp. 7-35, (2020); Azevedo, Americo Lopes, Grasp the challenge of digital transition in smes—a training course geared towards decision-makers, Education Sciences, 11, 4, (2021); Bahrini, Raéf, Impact of information and communication technology on economic growth: Evidence from developing countries, Economies, 7, 1, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277099","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153759660"

However, empirical research examining the effect of FinTech on green finance remains underexplored. In light of the advantageous position of green credit in the development of green finance in China, this study analyzes the impact of FinTech on green credit development using polluting listed firms in 2012–2021. The results show that FinTech significantly improves the development of green credit, affecting it through two crucial mechanisms: information asymmetry and green credit allocation efficiency. Additionally, heterogeneity analysis reveals that FinTech has a more significant impact on regions with higher government environmental objectives, small-to-medium enterprises with low carbon emissions, and firms with high external ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) scores. Overall, our findings indicate that financial institutions should be committed to leveraging FinTech for the pre-loan investigation of green credit, and policymakers should encourage the development of FinTech in order to perfect environmental information disclosure policies to establish environmental information-sharing platforms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FinTech; green credit; green credit allocation efficiency; information asymmetry","asymmetry; carbon emission; credit provision; financial system; heterogeneity; policy making; small and medium-sized enterprise; China","","","This paper gratefully acknowledges financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China “impact assessment and mechanism of digital finance on residents’ consumption inequality” (No. 21CJY045).","Wang, Chunyang, Pollution and corporate valuation: evidence from China, Applied Economics, 51, 32, pp. 3516-3530, (2019); Liu, Li, Output and welfare effect of green credit in China: Evidence from an estimated DSGE model, Journal of Cleaner Production, 294, (2021); Wen, Huwei, Green credit policy, credit allocation efficiency and upgrade of energy-intensive enterprises, Energy Economics, 94, (2021); Muganyi, Tadiwanashe, Green finance, fintech and environmental protection: Evidence from China, Environmental Science and Ecotechnology, 7, (2021); Swain, Srishti, ABCD technology-AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing and Data security in Islamic banking sector∗, pp. 58-62, (2022); Fintech Credit Market Structure Business Models and Financial Stability Implications, (2017); Fuster, Andreas, The Role of Technology in Mortgage Lending, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1854-1899, (2019); Peng, Zhikai, Spillover Effect of the Interaction between Fintech and the Real Economy Based on Tail Risk Dependent Structure Analysis, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 13, (2022); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Zhou, Guangyou, The impact of fintech innovation on green growth in China: Mediating effect of green finance, Ecological Economics, 193, (2022)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152692075"

It also compares the core aspects of Sukuk literature with conventional bonds and suggests the point of differences between them. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quali-quantitative approach with the help of segmented bibliometric analysis to describe core differences and commonalities in various Sukuk structures in terms of core authors, countries, sources, affiliation, documents and keywords. In addition, it deploys “biblioshiny” from R-package “bibliometrix 3.0” to identify key influential aspects of different Sukuk instruments. Findings: Results reported that Malaysia is the core contributing country in Sukuk publications and the center of author correspondence. There is a structural difference among various Sukuk instruments. The significant literature commonalities in Ijarah, Mudarabah, Musharakah and Murabahah Sukuk affiliations and globally cited journal articles are also found. However, the influential aspects of Sukuk compared with conventional bonds are different from other Sukuk literature. It also conducted a keyword analysis to report significant themes in the literature. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge as it helps investors to understand the shariah permissibility and investment supremacy of various Sukuk alternatives. Investors, policymakers, scholars and researchers should understand the dynamics of multiple Sukuk structures and their Shari’ah permissibility.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to gather responses from logistics service providers (LSPs), including strategic logistics units (manufacturing/brand owners) in Malaysia, which offer Halal logistics services. Findings: Halal traceability technology system and Halal traceability training are two critical domains to strengthen market recognition of Halal logistics brand for LSPs. The study found that the Halal logistics brand played a mediating role in connecting the usage of Halal traceability technology and logistics performance. Practical implications: The logistics industry needs to focus on Halal logistics services as a unique proposition. The ability of LSPs to build a Halal logistics brand thru traceability technology had created positive impressions for clients. LSPs must consistently engage in Halal training and remain technologically alert to build Halal brand value. Halal-based strategic branding will assist an LSP to stand out among its competitors. Originality/value: Even though Halal branding has been studied widely, little attention has been given to how the usage of Halal traceability technology can improve Halal logistics branding and logistics operational performance.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with several crowdfunding professionals concerning the application of Qard Hasan in Islamic crowdfunding. To realise the purpose of this study, the data is subjected to thematic analysis. Findings: The finding reveals that though it is often argued that Qard Hasan is basically not a business-oriented instrument, a closer look at the framework reveals the uniqueness and flexibility of this instrument to be adopted as a viable financial instrument for crowdfunding in financing micro-enterprises in Malaysia. Although it is associated with various risks including default risk and the risk of attracting big funds. However, these risks can be managed and overcome by using FinTech mechanisms such as blockchain to carry out due diligence, monitor the project and ensure the repayment in installment. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study may not be suitable for generalisation to all crowdfunding practices as the semi-structured interview is concentrated predominantly in Malaysia. However, it still provides valuable contributions to the Islamic crowdfunding sector in Malaysia between theory and practice. Practical implications: The Qard Hasan crowdfunding framework in this study can potentially be applied to help micro-entrepreneurs reach out to financial services within their means. This framework provides means to grow the micro-enterprise sector. Social implications: Qard Hasan crowdfunding will effectively alleviate poverty by creating an avenue of opportunities for business enterprises and close the gap between the wealthy and the poor classes in society, which will eventually bring about more cooperation, more collaboration and cultivate a generous society. Originality/value: In spite of the fact that Islamic crowdfunding is not a new topic in research, it lacks empirical studies, particularly qualitative analysis. As this study engages with experts in Shari’ah and crowdfunding regarding the potential application of Qard Hasan, it highlights a fresh discussion both in theory and practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic crowdfunding; Islamic finance; Micro-enterprises; Qard Hasan","","","","","Abdullah, Mohammad, Analysing the moral aspect of qard: a shariah perspective, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 8, 2, pp. 171-184, (2015); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); International Journal of Economics Management and Accounting, (2011); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Ijief, (2020); Muqtasid Jurnal Ekonomi Dan Perbankan Syariah, (2021); Amin, Hanudin, Determinants of Qardhul Hassan financing acceptance among Malaysian bank customers: An empirical analysis, International Journal of Business and Society, 11, 1, pp. 1-16, (2010); Perceptions of Islamic Banker on Qardhul Hasan in Malaysia Islamic Bank Available at, (2012); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Educational Research Planning Conducting and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research, (2002)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17554179; 17554187","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129873755"

The proposed models combine the unique features of social solidarity, cooperation “Ta’awan,” meeting religious requirements and providing financing more fairly and equitably. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is applied in this study through semi-structured interviews with several Libyan experts, including Islamic bankers, Shariah scholars, MSMEs experts, Islamic microfinance experts and academicians. The data collected from 2019 to 2021 and thematic analysis by computer-based software NVivo is used to analyze the data. Findings: The results indicate that the proposed Islamic equity-based microfinance models are suitable and applicable in Libya. This study also reveals that the proposed models have numerous potential benefits not only in meeting the financial needs of MSMEs but also in meeting the government objectives in economic divarication and socioeconomic development. Research limitations/implications: First, the study proposes the applicability and suitability of Islamic equity-based models in financing MSMEs only, while large firms are excluded from the study. Second, the study only proposes and tests the applicability of Islamic equity-modes of financing contracts, namely, Musharakah and Mudarabah, while Islamic debt-based financing models are not included. Finally, as there is no practical evidence of using those models for financing MSMEs in Libya, this study lacks empirical evaluations of equity models’ real benefits on income, employment generation, living standards improvement and business growth and sustainability. Practical implications: Given the importance of the MSMEs sector for the State of Libya’s economic growth, it is expected that the findings of this study can be of assistance in formulating guidelines and implementing Islamic equity-based microfinance programs. Besides, it can be a valuable source of information for policymakers for improving the functions of the current microfinance programs in the country. Additionally, as studies concerning Islamic alternative models for financing MSMEs are scarce, the current study can also be a reference point for researchers, academicians, practitioners and other stakeholders. Social implications: Providing capital support for the underfunded economy segment, attracting small savings, increasing investments and developing entrepreneurial skills could lead to improved economic productivity and growth. Originality/value: The present study proposes the structure of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for MSMEs in Libya and verifies the suitability of those proposed models among Libyan experts.

The more people who use Twitter, the more usernames are used, and the system will automatically reject new user requests with usernames that have already been used.

Data were obtained from document studies and interviews with sellers and buyers of usernames via Twitter direct messages. The results of the research showed that buying and selling usernames are an illegal and prohibited sale because many inappropriate behaviors, such as hacking, are found, resulting in nonfulfillment of the conditions for the objects bought and sold. Islamic law stipulates that traded objects must meet requirements such as perfect ownership, clear, useful, and halal.

Particularly, in Islamic finance environment it could not attract significant attention from the researchers, academicians, and practitioners. Though, some studies have discussed the tools of Islamic social finance, however, the focus on developing a practicable conceptual framework remained least attentive in recent studies. This study aims to fill this gap and attract the attention of all stakeholders to augment the Islamic Social finance theory and provide grounds for practitioners and academicians to implement technological tools to enhance its social impact. This study uses a qualitative library research approach to develop the spectrum of Islamic social finance and identify the issues faced by the key players within the spectrum. Likewise, technological advancement in the form of crowdfunding is exclusively proposed for the Islamic social finance spectrum in order to overcome all related issues and meet the objectives of SharÊ'ah i.e., MaqÉÎid al SharÊ'ah which are embedded in its CSR values. This study is envisioned to open the doors of debate for academicians to further enhance the general theory of Islamic Social finance.

Based on blockchain, cryptocurrencies are among the most significant technological advancements of the 21st century. They have provided a new way of transacting and investing. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, there has been an ongoing debate about their compatibility with various ethical and religious beliefs. One such belief system is the Sharī‘a Law, which governs the financial practices of Muslims, worldwide. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity, it is essential to understand their compatibility with the Sharī‘a Law and resolve any resulting ethical dilemmas. The fundamental issue is whether cryptocurrencies violate the principles of Sharī‘a or can be considered a permissible investment option for Muslims. The article provides a detailed overview about digital currencies. It also explores the different types of digital currencies and their underlying technologies, such as block chain and smart contracts. This research relies on a quantitative approach, utilizing a systematic review of articles By extracting and analyzing data from scholarly works, the study aims to quantify the existing discourse on the compatibility of cryptocurrencies with Sharī‘a Law. This method enables the synthesis of quantitative insights from authoritative sources, contributing to a robust understanding of the ethical implications and adherence to Sharī‘a principles in the context of cryptocurrency use. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","block chain; comparative analysis; cryptocurrencies; digital advancement; Sharī‘a law","","","","","undefined, (2021); Blockchain A Graph Primer, (2017); Alfar, Abdelrahman J.K., The determinants of issuing central bank digital currencies, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023); Institute of Scientific Communications Conference, (2020); undefined; Castrén, Olli, Digital currencies in financial networks, Journal of Financial Stability, 60, (2022); Glyn Davies A History of Money from Ancient Times to the Present Day, (1994); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Ijief, (2020); Hoang, Yen Hai, Central bank digital currency: A systematic literature review using text mining approach, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023); Trkh Al Nuqd Al Islmiyyah, (1988)","","University of Management and Technology","","","","","","20750943; 25200313","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192069787"

The critique focuses on three aspects of the ban. The first is criticism for banning cryptocurrency which is considered to contain garar and ḍarār, and is contrary to Law No. 7 of 2011 and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 17 of 2015. The second is criticism of the illegality of buying/selling cryptocurrency, which is positioned as a digital asset/commodity that contains garar, ḍarār, qimār, and does not meet the sil’ah criteria. The third is criticism of the permissibility of cryptocurrency as a commodity/asset when it fulfills the sil’aḥ criteria and has underlying and clear legal benefits to be traded. This study adopted a qualitative approach. The conclusion reveals that MUI's fatwā on cryptocurrencies was not built on solid legal reasoning and did not consider the benefits of technological advances. The MUI's fatwā is based on the principles of Islamic law, specifically garar, ḍarār, and qimār, which are used to evaluate the legality of trading commodities or digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to note that the MUI's fatwā does not consider the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as their use as a new form of investment and their potential to revolutionize industries by enhancing security, and efficiency, and creating new trading opportunities in the digital age. In terms of non-Sharia technology, it is seen as a tool that can be used for good or evil, and its permissibility depends on its use. Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, is considered acceptable because it makes transactions more secure and enables the use of smart contracts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Islamic law; MUI’s Fatwā","","","","We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the individuals and institutions who made this research possible.

One of the needs for financial digitalization in the study of Islamic contracts and Islamic business law is the use of digital platforms with digital currencies. Regarding the merits and downsides of its Sharia restrictions and its halal certification, which is currently under discussion, digital currencies and perks have generated controversy in Jordan and other Islamic countries. Methods: This study intends to analyze the legal foundations of digital currency from Jordanian and Islamic legal perspectives. The descriptive-qualitative research approach was utilized, and data collection processes included documentation and a literature review. All legal possibilities that may be drawn from Islamic law in order to investigate the legality of digital currencies are explored further and used to obtain the conclusions of this study. Results: A review of Sharia reasons and consideration for the wellbeing of the people suggests that digital currencies in their current form are incompatible with it and must adhere to the stipulations of Islamic finance. Therefore, digital currencies are unsuitable as a store of value or wealth due to their erratic swings, lack of purchasing power, and instant responsiveness to any technical problem, technical penetration, or official circumstance. Due to market instability, digital currencies can't be utilized to defer payments, settle debts, or repay loans. Conclusions: Digital currencies are speculative; not real money. Most of those who have this money are speculators seeking a quick payoff. Sharia views digital currency trading as gambling due to its high degree of volatility. Jordan's government should regulate digital currency use to meet demand. Digital currencies must be addressed under e-commerce laws. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; Digital Currencies; Digital Representation; Functions of Money; Jordan Law; The Physical Presence of Currency","article; cryptocurrency; documentation; electronic commerce; finance; gambling; government; human; Jordan; law; peer review; purchasing power; qualitative research; wellbeing","","","Authors would like to thank Jadara and Yarmouk Universities for their support and facilitation.","Crypto 82, (1982); Kethineni, Sesha R., The Rise in Popularity of Cryptocurrency and Associated Criminal Activity, International Criminal Justice Review, 30, 3, pp. 325-344, (2020); Yelowitz, Aaron S., Characteristics of Bitcoin users: an analysis of Google search data, Applied Economics Letters, 22, 13, pp. 1030-1036, (2015); Cpa Journal, (2017); Legal Status of Online Currencies are Bitcoins the Future Melbourne Business School, (2016); See the Circular Issued by the Central Bank of Jordan Regarding Cryptocurrencies, (2020); Tiered Cbdc and the Financial System, (2020); Financial Technology Future Trends in Financial Business, (2016); Monetary Plurality in Local Regional and Global Economies, (2019); Tafhim Ikim Journal of Islam and the Contemporary World, (2022)","","F1000 Research Ltd","","","","","","20461402","","","37868298","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181782774"

The study used normative legal research methods. This research approach used a conceptual approach through reasoning the concepts of sustainable financing, green sukuk, and other concepts relevant to the topic of study to strengthen the discussion argument. The study showed that there are 2 (two) components of the relevance of the Sustainable Financing paradigm as the basis for implementing green sukuk in Indonesia. First, the implementation of green sukuk in various countries has rules that accommodate sustainable financing in response to climate change problems. Second, the sustainable financing Paradigm is relevant as a source of green sukuk legal construction to strengthen the policy basis for implementing environmentally sound investment in Indonesia.

First, these sukuk effectively combat pressing environmental issues and play a pivotal role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,33 aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Furthermore, they serve as a means to finance renewable energy initiatives and other environmentally friendly projects, thus contributing significantly to sustainable development goals.34 An important facet of green sukuk lies in their ability to attract a broader investor base, particularly those interested in supporting sustainable and responsible investments, thereby enlarging the pool of funding available for eco-friendly initiatives. This increased investment not only expands the market's scope but also offers issuers access to new avenues for financial support, enhancing the overall reach and impact of these instruments. Additionally, green sukuk proves instrumental for countries facing financial deficits in pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), acting as a viable financial solution for funding gaps. One of their key features involves the assurance of transparency and accountability through regular sustainability reporting, ensuring that the raised funds are used for the intended environmental and social projects. Finally, by directing capital towards projects with clear environmental and social benefits, green sukuk significantly contributes to sustainable development efforts on a global scale.","Abdullah, Mohammad Syafiq, What drives green sukuk?

On the other hand, Islamic banking is called asset-backed due to Islamic financial concepts, so the supply chain flows of the assets in normal, conventional and Islamic finance scenarios are different. However, studies are scarce in this regard. Therefore, the study’s purpose is to elaborate on the supply chain flows of the assets in normal, conventional, and Islamic financing scenarios. This is a conceptual paper, which uses the library research method and participant observation background of the principal researcher. This study found three propositions that show Islamic banks have a unique stake in the supply chain flows of their financed assets. They are not only stakeholders in the financial and informational supply chain flows, but they must be considered the stakeholders in the ownership supply chain flow. This point makes them different from conventional financers as well as different from the normal supply chain flows of the assets. This study will support making a win-win situation for supply chain entities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financed assets; financial supply chain flow; ownership supply chain flow; physical supply chain flow; supply chain flows","","","","","Turkish Journal of Islamic Economics Tujise, (2022); Akyüz, Goknur Arzu, Strategic management perspectives on supply chain, Management Review Quarterly, 70, 2, pp. 213-241, (2020); Oman Chapter of Arabian Journal of Business and Management Review, (2013); Arfan, Abbas, A strategy for strengthening public perception toward sharia banking, Banks and Bank Systems, 16, 2, pp. 170-181, (2021); Asad, Muzaffar, A crital review of Islamic and conventional banking in digital era: A case of Pakistan, International Journal of Engineering and Technology (UAE), 7, 4, pp. 57-59, (2018); Bals, Cristof, Toward a supply chain finance (SCF) ecosystem – Proposing a framework and agenda for future research, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 2, pp. 105-117, (2019); Proceeding of the 16th Imp Conference in Bath, (2000); Burmester, Mike V.D., An RFID-based smart structure for the supply chain: Resilient scanning proofs and ownership transfer with positive secrecy capacity channels, Sensors, 17, 7, (2017); Essays on Supply Chain Finance, (2016); Farooq, Mohammad Omar, Conceptualization of the real economy and Islamic finance: Transformation beyond the asset-link rhetoric, Thunderbird International Business Review, 61, 5, pp. 685-696, (2019)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","1758941X; 17589401","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174186291"

Many of the halal food in those countries are supplied by SMEs. Although the importance of this sector is certain, studies investigating the organizational aspect of halal food SMEs are still limited. The present study tries to expand the knowledge of organizational behaviour aspects in halal food SMEs since it is crucial in creating the sustainability of halal food SMEs. The present study uses partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The questions used to measure the variables used in this study were developed by adopting previous studies’ instruments. This research discovered the importance of IT capability and organizational learning on organizational performance. IT capability, Knowledge transfer effectiveness, and Absorptive capacity are found to have a significant relationship with organizational performance measured by Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Furthermore, the effect of IT capability and Knowledge transfer effectiveness are not only direct but also mediated by Absorptive capacity. From the findings, there are key implications. First, by utilizing digital capabilities in their business processes, SMEs can more easily obtain new knowledge. Second, when SMEs learn new things from digitalization, they can associate their knowledge with new information. Third, the ability to use technology helps human resources in SMEs to increase knowledge, thus encouraging SMEs to create innovation and business competitiveness. This ultimately has an impact on increasing sales and cost-effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","absorptive capacity; IT capability; knowledge transfer effectiveness; organizational learning; organizational performance; Smes","","","","This work is part of the research entitled “The Effect of IT Capability Through Organizational Learning Processes on the Performance of Halal Food SME in Indonesia during the Post COVID-19 Economic Recovery Period,” funded by Research Grant Bank Indonesia 2022 with grant number 24/4/PKS/BINS/2022.

In-depth interviews are used for data collection to develop the framework while focus group discussions are used for validation. The in-depth interviews are carried out with various stakeholders, such as the government, association, MSMEs, suppliers, and banking. Findings show that blockchain technology as corporate governance innovation framework has the potential to reduce asymmetric information and credit risk. The reason is that blockchain technology can facilitate recording, immutable, partial decentralisation, and storage of business and financial transactions on a digital network and all stakeholders can access information in a transparent and valid manner that can increase transparency, accountability, responsibility, and fairness.

The data was analysed with Smart-PLS and IBM-SPSS. Except for the influence of perceived security on perceived usefulness, all of the supposed relationships were supported in this study. Furthermore, all suggested mediating relationships were supported, with the exception of the mediation role of perceived usefulness between the influence of perceived security on behavioural intention.

For the protection of cyberspace from hackers and other harmful people, biometric security is growing more and more popular among organizations, individuals and enterprises. The word 'cyber security' refers to the procedures, techniques, and tools used to safeguard data, network system, computer networks and software from potential attacks online. Online financial service delivery is referred to as 'cyber banking.' As the trend of exchanging things has changed, internet banking has grown. Despite the benefits, there have been instances of security threat-related issues with Internet banking. To identify persons, biometric security verifies their physical attributes and behavioral traits. For identification verification, it is the most reliable and effective physical security method. According to biometric authentication, people can be recognized precisely based on their innate behavioral or physical traits. Numerous security measures have been implemented throughout the entire Internet banking service to address these issues. Globally, cybercrime has deep roots and poses a significant threat to the occurrence of criminal or terrorist behavior. Without being addressed by a single authority, these risks can compromise security on the inside as well as the outside. If the cybercrime goes unnoticed, both money and personal data are lost. Internet services and information infrastructure have previously been targeted in assaults. Online fraud and hacker attacks are only two examples of the daily computer-related crimes that take place. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most reliable foundation for facilitating high-quality, comfortable human living. IoT has had a substantial impact across a range of application domains. Smart gadgets are more vulnerable to hackers because of their rapid development and trust in wireless mechanics for data transport. As a result, the rate of cybercrime is rising daily. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity emerges because of technological advancement and poses a risk to public safety, personal property rights, and privacy protection for people.

Recently, digital crowdfunding has been considered a new unique tool for pooling funds through online platforms. This modern fundraising technique has successfully supported business activities and community-based projects. This concept can be utilized to support the current student entrepreneurship programs at universities, where it was reported that these institutions had experienced a limitation in terms of budget. Over the period, students at higher education institutions have witnessed challenges and difficulties in surviving their learning journey, particularly in terms of financial capability. Entrepreneurship is believed to be able to help students discover an additional income during their studies. Based on the interview, it was found that crowdfunding should be promoted to support small entrepreneurs, including students. However, proper models are needed to ensure crowdfunding is not misused and its efficiency and applicability. Regarding student entrepreneurship programs, Waqf and Infaq can be applied as crowdfunding models.

This study compared legal regulations in the United States that analysed the readiness of regulations and Indonesia's legal loopholes in responding to the development of the cryptocurrency business. As a result, cryptocurrency in Indonesia is susceptible to being used as a money-laundering tool due to the novelty of the technology, the anonymity it provides its users, and the immaturity of the regulations governing it. Therefore, it is necessary to create a cryptocurrency that can follow the “Travel Rule” and collect and share information about the people who send and receive cryptocurrency, like in the US. The study also argues that passive detection is used to detect the identity of cryptocurrency users through a centralised service.

Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness distribution process and lack of transparency in the zakat management are commonly cited as key impediments (bin Khatiman et al., 2021). Blockchain is expected to solve these issues due to its ability to record and trace every transaction, allowing administrators to discharge their accountability to zakat stakeholders. Thus, this study intended to develop a zakat collection blockchain system with the aim to provide economical and integrated continuous real-time zakat transactions, transparency and traceability by developing smart contracts in zakat management. The study employed four stages of process based on waterfall model starting from the interview session and analyse of the standard operating procedure (SOP) on zakat collection in the Zakat Collection Centre or Pusat Pungutan Zakat-Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (PPZ-MAIWP). Then, design requirement specification (DRS) is employed after being reviewed and approved by PPZ-MAIWP. The results show that the development of blockchain in the zakat collection system could be eradicating extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity among the community in the country. The study contributes through a transparent and reliable environment for exchanging data and carrying out transactions through a decentralized digital ledger technology to record anything of value and as a result able to ensure transparency, reliability, trust ability and traceability of the zakat transactions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Fintech; Islamic Finance; Malaysia; Smart Contract; Zakat","","","","","Ab Rahman, Azman, Zakat institution in Malaysia: Problems and issues, Global Journal Al-Thaqafah, 2, 1, pp. 35-41, (2012); Abaidoo, Rexford, Financial development and institutional quality among emerging economies, Journal of Economics and Development, 24, 3, pp. 198-216, (2022); International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology, (2016); Fiqh Az Zakat A Comparative Study, (1999); Alam, Nafis, Fintech and Islamic finance: Digitalization, development and disruption, pp. 1-178, (2019); Bach, L.

We propose a blockchain tokenised security design, based on a sertificate similar to Sukuk, an Islamic finance asset, that draws inspiration from Equipment Trust Certificates and is managed by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), that may issue blockchain tokenised certificates. These certificates grant rights related to an investment property. Each series of certificates represents specific property and will be a liability of the SPV that owns the property. In general, the tokens used resemble but remain categorically distinct from asset-backed securities. Their performance still depends on the underlying asset’s performance. Most important, token owners do not become partners in the SPV but are granted fractional ownership and rights on the underlying property. The proposed token mechanism could prevent delays in the transaction process related to transferring ownership of a property. It could split at some point to allow for the creation of ownership and income rights. The proposed security design potentially protects investors’ legal rights better without standard application of investors becoming partners in the SPV while shortening the transaction times, and increasing transparency and asset liquidity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; contract design; real estate investment; smart contracts; special purpose vehicle; tokenisation","certification; financial market; financial system; investment; property market","","","","Journal of Asian Scientific Research, (2014); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Bamakan, Seyed Mojtaba Hosseini, Patents and intellectual property assets as non-fungible tokens; key technologies and challenges, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Baum, Andrew, Tokenization—The future of real estate investment?, Journal of Portfolio Management, 47, 10, pp. 41-61, (2021); Berentsen, Aleksander, A short introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, 100, 1, pp. 1-16, (2018); Tokenized Real Estate 2021 Update, (2021); Global Alternative Finance Market Benchmarking Report, (2019); Chen, Yan, Blockchain tokens and the potential democratization of entrepreneurship and innovation, Business Horizons, 61, 4, pp. 567-575, (2018); Chow, Yuen Leng, Is tokenization of real estate ready for lift off in APAC?, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 40, 3, pp. 284-290, (2022); A Study on the History and Functionality of Real Estate Crowdfunding, (2016)","","Routledge","","","","","","14664453; 09599916","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147303369"

Losing trust in conventional banking, advancement of technology and internet globally, and customers craving for trustworthy and reliable financial systems are the main incentives of expansion and growth of Fintech and Islamic Finance. In view of this growth, the current study tests the adoption of the novel mechanism Fintech Value Chain Financing (FVCF) using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model among potential users, Aarti (middlemen) in the agriculture sector. A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted; 500 questionnaires were distributed following purposive sampling to collect data for analysis. Findings revealed that perceived benefits expectancy, perceived efforts expectancy, perceived credibility, anxiety, and consumer innovativeness are strong predictors of adoption of FVCF. This study is pioneer in its kind. The study’s contribution to the literature is a newly operationalized instrument for the constructs along with other variables that extend the UTAUT model and the findings provide new insights to consider the UTAUT model to segregate organization based variables.

Accordingly, this study aims to develop a practical framework for evaluating the sustainability reporting performance of Islamic banks in the purview of the SDGs. This study employed the most recent Global Reporting Initiative and religious sustainability indicators to establish the measurement framework for evaluating sustainability reporting in relation to the SDGs. Centering on the Malaysian Islamic banks, this study found that overall performance on corporate sustainability reporting is quite low, though it has increased over time from 2011–2020. The bank-wise analysis implies that the SDGs reporting differs for Islamic banks, where most of the banks outperform on SDGs disclosure scores. Further, the SDG-wise analysis indicates that SDG-9, SDG-17, SDG-11, and SDG-1 appear to have the highest disclosure scores. Nevertheless, SDG-16 revealed the least SDG disclosure score, indicating that the sampled Islamic banks do not provide complete information about addressing sustainability-related issues. The outcome of the study might be useful to the regulators and managers of Islamic banks in embedding sustainability into their strategy for reporting on SDGs. This will help in recognizing the strong and weak points of their sustainability reporting procedures regarding the SDGs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agenda 2030; corporate social responsibility (CSR); environmental sustainability; millennium development goals (MDGs); sustainability reporting; triple bottom line (TBL)","banking; corporate social responsibility; performance assessment; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal","","","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the Editor-in-Chief Prof. Guofan Shao for their constructive comments during the review process that improved the quality of the manuscript.","Abid, Muhammad Farrukh, Value creation or value destruction: Conceptualizing the experiential nature of value-in-use, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 21, 3, pp. 583-601, (2022); Akhtar, Shakeb, Examine the key drivers affecting bottom line: A panel estimation study of indian commercial bank, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 9, pp. 1114-1125, (2020); Ali, Syed Emad Azhar, Predicting Delinquency on Mortgage Loans: An Exhaustive Parametric Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques, International Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 12, 1, pp. 1-13, (2021); Allen, Cameron Ian, National pathways to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A comparative review of scenario modelling tools, Environmental Science and Policy, 66, pp. 199-207, (2016); Amran, Azlan Bin, Social responsibility disclosure in Islamic banks: a comparative study of Indonesia and Malaysia, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 15, 1, pp. 99-115, (2017); Ashrafi, Mehrnaz, Corporate sustainability in Canadian and US maritime ports, Journal of Cleaner Production, 220, pp. 386-397, (2019); Ashrafi, Mehrnaz, ‘How corporate social responsibility can be integrated into corporate sustainability: a theoretical review of their relationships’, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 25, 8, pp. 671-681, (2018); Beekaroo, Dickcha, Developing a sustainability index for Mauritian manufacturing companies, Ecological Indicators, 96, pp. 250-257, (2019); Bubicz, Marta Elisa, Social sustainability management in the apparel supply chains, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Carter, Craig R., A framework of sustainable supply chain management: Moving toward new theory, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 38, 5, pp. 360-387, (2008)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13504509; 17452627","","IJSDB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140054921"

The research design is qualitative and secondary source analysis is conducted. Secondary data is collected from relevant journal articles, research papers, editorials, websites and official documents. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that different key drivers played an influential role in the progress of the Fintech industry in Malaysia. Financial literacy programs and Malaysia Stack are some notable initiatives that support the Fintech progress in Malaysia. A range of Fintech businesses is operating in Malaysia that are transforming different banking services including payments solutions, lending personal loans, credit cards, personal finance management solutions and one-stop-shop online banking. Underserved populations, flexible regulatory environment and increased level of interest of state authorities are some of the critical aspects for the future progress of Fintech business in Malaysia. The research paper explains the role of Fintech businesses in the Malaysian banking industry.

We adapt the working capital framework of successful US companies like Amazon and Walmart and model an innovative Murabaha facility as trade credit within the real sector of the economy. We then test its robustness in a range of simulation tests. Our approach is novel and stands in contrast to the familiar financial sector fixed-income facilities, characteristic of Western economies, stealthily mimicked as mark-up (interest rate based) Murabaha by Islamic banks. We argue that this is neither appropriate nor effective for Islamic economies, making them fragile under monetary pressures in crises like the current coronavirus and energy ones. Our simulation results indicate that the trade credit Murabaha not only transforms debt into a risk-sharing one but also offers more competitive financing rates, reduces systemic risk, and improves financial stability. Furthermore, our results imply that the trade credit Murabaha can increase the efficiency of Islamic financial systems and make them more resilient to shocks. Consequently, this paper discusses the integration of our novel Murabaha within a recreated architecture of Universal Banking. As an implication, this should promote business activity and contribute to global growth. Finally, we recommend how to deploy our novel Murabaha based on trade credit (as opposed to the currently deployed fixed-income-mimicked Murabaha) to alleviate twin agency debt costs (risk shifting, underinvestment) and solve the ownership transfer problem of modern Islamic banking. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crisis; Islamic banking; Mark-up (Murabaha) financing; Trade credit; Universal banking","","","","We are grateful to Dalal Aassouli, Chris Adcock, Habib Ahmed, Nigar Hashimzade, Andreas Jobst, Anthony Miller, Sabur Mollah, Victor Murinde, Bibhas Saha, Mustapha Sheikh, Marti G.

Malaysia as one effective country in the food industry and leading country in Halal food brand emphasized the importance of food quality in both operation and supply chain. Despite the importance of the Halal food industry to countries' economy including Malaysia, this industry is facing multiple challenges. In addition, halal food literature still in the infant stage despite the rapid growth of this important industry. Therefore, this review study aims to identify the challenges that surrounded the Halal industry worldwide generally and Malaysian firms particularly. This study also aims to identify the potential solution to overcome Halal food challenges. The finding of this study uncovers multiple challenges surrounded the Halal food industry in operation, marketing, and certification processes. This study also suggests that the application of the manufacturing execution system can bring a new insight to overcome Halal food challenges.

It is important for implementing small and medium-sized initiatives in the country. At the same time, this method of attracting funds in Islamic countries is limited by the complexity of integrating Islamic values with modern financial solutions. This study is devoted to analysing the features of the development of Equity-Based crowdfunding in Oman using the example of the Ethis platform as the only Islamic crowdfunding platform in the country. The methodological basis of the research is qualitative analysis methods based on the analysis of statistical data or quantitative indicators. A conceptual approach was used to analyse scholarly articles, research papers, and online sources related to Islamic Equity-Based crowdfunding. The Islamic Equity-Based crowdfunding platform Ethis was chosen as the subject of the study because it has a successful track record of achieving Shariah-compliant investment goals. Based on the results of the analysis of the functioning of the Islamic share crowdfunding platform in Oman, a conclusion about the importance of adopting the Capital Markets Authority's Decision No. E/153/2021 for developing the crowdfunding industry in Oman was made. The study theoretically proves the important role of CMA's certification in increasing the legitimacy of crowdfunding platforms and public trust in the Omani Equity-Based crowdfunding industry. At the same time, it was concluded that the existing legal restrictions on the expansion of the investor community serve as disincentives for the development of investing in crowdfunding among the general public. In addition, the small number of Equity-Based crowdfunding platforms in Oman is due to the difficulty of combining traditional Islamic values with modern financial technology. It actualises the need to develop a comprehensive approach to the harmonisation of Islamic traditions with the specifics of the development of digital financial technologies. The results of the study are essential for researchers, practitioners and other interested persons from the point of view of deepening the basic principles of crowdfunding development and promoting their implementation in the context of increasing profits from the use of crowdfunding platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crowdfunding; crowdsourcing; Ethis platform; financial technology; Islamic finance; Shariah-compliant","","","","","International Journal of Organizational Analysis, (2022); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); Pitchay, Anwar Allah, Self-determination theory and individuals’ intention to participate in donation crowdfunding, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 15, 3, pp. 506-526, (2022); Access to Finance and Human Developmentessays on Zakah Awqaf and Microfinance, (2015); Alshater, Muneer Maher, Fintech in islamic finance literature: A review, Heliyon, 8, 9, (2022); Baber, Hasnan, Examining the intentions to use crowdfunding platform - An extended technology acceptance model, International Journal of Services, Economics and Management, 12, 2, pp. 149-163, (2021); Innovator S Dilemma, (2000); undefined, (2023); Colombo, Massimo G., Receiving external equity following successfully crowdfunded technological projects: an informational mechanism, Small Business Economics, 56, 4, pp. 1507-1529, (2021)","","Academic Research and Publishing UG","","","","","","25206761; 25206311","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008305145"

The emergence of the metaverse has become an inevitable part of this progress. It serves as a digital world, wherein everyone is able carry out a vast array of activities, including economic transactions. The emergence of digital assets, that has encouraged serious discussion, is inseparable from Islamic law. One of these digital assets is the Non-Fungible Token (NFT). This digital asset is the focus of this study, specifically on for its posibility to become material guarantees. This article employs a qualitative study and presented descriptively through the perspective of Islamic law. The result of this study is that the pledged-object (marhūn) has certain primary conditions for it to be functional, namely: it is a property, it has value, it can be traded, its asset value is clearly known, and it is actually owned by the guarantor (rāhin). The concept of marhūn as a valuable object ultimately answers that NFT is included in the marhūn category. However, since NFTs do not stand alone if the transaction currency used in the metaverse is cryptocurrencies, al-rahn transactions using NFTs become less favourable considering Cyrptocurrency is deemed to be haram. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic law; marhūn; metaverse; mortgaging","","","","","The difference between the present and the mortgagee in the capture and recovery of the mortgaged thing in islamic jurisprudence""Comparative jurisprudence Study, 21, 4, pp. 2981-3032; Ahn, Sun Joo (Grace), The Bifold Triadic Relationships Framework: A Theoretical Primer for Advertising Research in the Metaverse, Journal of Advertising, 51, 5, pp. 592-607, (2022); Majallah Kuliyyat Al Dirasat Al Islamiyah Wal Arabiyah Lil Banat Bil Iskandariyah, (2017); Al Sharhal Saghir Ala Aqrab Al Masalikila Madhhab Al Imam Malik, (1986); Al Rahn Fil Fiqh Al Islamiy, (1985); Journal of Islamic Sciences, (2021); Majallah Al Dirasat Al Islamiyah Wal Buhuts Al Akadimiyah, (2021); Tufat Al Fuqah, (2025); Al Majallah Al Urduniyah Fi Al Dirasat Al Islamiyah, (2021); Mughani Al Muhtaj Ela Ma Rifat Ma Ani Alfaz Al Minhaj, (2025)","","Faculty of Law, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta","","","","","","08548919; 25031023","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172223986"

After analyzing the results, we perceived a partial misalignment between the existing literature on the concept of fintech and the perspective of traditional financial sector professionals concerning this construct. In contrast to the literature surveyed, the respondents lack perception regarding the potential of fintech to constitute disruptive technology for the traditional financial sector—radically transforming or even eliminating it. In addition, traditional financial sector professionals have little insight into the potential of fintech to financially include the low-income population, owing to their lower costs and greater ease of use. Finally, traditional financial sector professionals failed to appreciate the need to develop a legal and regulatory framework for the performance of fintech in emerging markets.

The exponentially growing amount of data has made it essential for firms to transform them into digital format for ensuring better flow and sharing of information across the organisation. Digitisation has been referred to as the process of converting various diverse forms of information, such as text, images, sound or voice, into an electronic format that leads to improved operations and reduced costs for firms. The research paper has discussed this digitisation process of a firm and analysed its consequent impact on the corporate governance. In this regard, various articles have been explored for the purposes of understanding how digitisation can improve or threaten corporate governance of firms. Digitisation has created some big disruptive storms some of which have resulted in a reimagined manner of doing business, affecting demand and supply principles in any company.

This paper proposes a theoretical model most suitable for Islamic Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) which enables Islamic MFIs’ to operate together with the existing financial models compliant with Islamic Shariah Law. This model is based on a distributed verification/decision-making process that might be realized (but not necessary) through blockchain. Among the available distributed verification techniques, blockchain technology is an attractive emerging computing paradigm due to its decentralized, immutable, shared, and secure data structure characteristics. This model proposes three significant propositions. First, sharing information through blockchain will allow a transparent network in MFI operations, which will raise confidence for donors resulting in a causal effect of a relatively lower profit rate to be charged by the MFIs. Second, the consensus mechanism will enable risk-sharing, a character of Islamic finance; thus, the MFIs will operate without any collateral for low-risk firms. Third, the double bottom line of MFIs' long-lasting paradox would be solved. As for practical implication of this proposed model, the causal impact of lower cost investment by the lenders would increase social welfare because of no collateral and no initial wealth requirement. The proposed model proposes a credit rationing approach where profit can be negative. No collateral will be used when calculating the creditworthiness of a borrower. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Distributed verification; Double bottom line; Islamic microfinance","","","","","Adegbite, Emmanuel Afolabi, Multiple influences on corporate governance practice in Nigeria: Agents, strategies and implications, International Business Review, 22, 3, pp. 524-538, (2013); Ahmad, Abu Umar Faruq, Islamic microfinance: The evidence from Australia, Humanomics, 25, 3, pp. 217-235, (2009); Fintech and Islamic Finance, (2019); Altwijry, Othman Ibrahim, Developing a Shari’ah based FinTech Money Creation Free [SFMCF] model for Islamic banking, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 15, 4, pp. 739-758, (2022); American University Law Review, (2004); Azad, Md Abul Kalam, Efficiency analysis of major microfinance institutions in Bangladesh: a Malmquist index approach, Quality and Quantity, 50, 4, pp. 1525-1537, (2016); Azim, Mohammad I., Combating corruption in a microfinance institution, Managerial Auditing Journal, 32, 4-5, pp. 445-462, (2017); Berger, Allen N., Tests of ex ante versus ex post theories of collateral using private and public information, Journal of Financial Economics, 100, 1, pp. 85-97, (2011); Berns, John P., Delegated monitoring in crowdfunded microfinance: Evidence from Kiva, Journal of Corporate Finance, 66, (2021); Bester, Helmut, Screening vs. Rationing in credit markets with imperfect information, American Economic Review, 75, 4, pp. 850-855, (1985)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21994730","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137083352"

Through its FinTech (Financial Technology) Strategy, Qatar has sought to embrace DLT, but its regulatory approach also remains cautious. Trade Finance is an ideal business process to be disrupted through the benefits of DLT and especially Blockchain technology, since its processes remain antiquated, inefficient and lack digitization. Blockchain as a form of DLT particularly offers the Trade Finance process not only more rapid, secure, cost-effective and efficient procedures, but importantly completely assures trust between importers and exporters and removes the requirement to place such trust in third-party intermediaries. Qatar can reap considerable economic benefits through the enhancement of its Trade Finance regulations enabling the adoption of such Blockchain technology. As such, the authors propose a roadmap and manual for the governance of the Trade Finance Blockchain ecosystem in Qatar. The authors propose multi-layered governance approach to the regulation of Blockchain in Qatar by (1) embracing international regulations and standards; (2) replicating foreign regional and national rules that are appropriate and innovative; and (3) applying sandbox regulations to Blockchain products and services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Financial technology; International regulations and standards; National regulations; Qatar; Sandbox regulations; Trade Finance","","","","Funding This publication was made possible by the NPRP award NPRP11C-1229-170007 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of the Qatar Foundation).

The transition to low carbon, green economy, and green sustainability has gained momentum simultaneously in developed and developing countries. The greening policy echoes the pending climate change and its entrenching disruptions. Financial technology, or FinTech seems to be a promising direction in unlocking the green dilemma; to be concrete, FinTech and the green economy are separately documented in the literature. Against this background, the current study investigates the intersection between green economic growth and FinTech by conducting a systematic-cum-bibliometric analysis of published papers in the Scopus database with the goal of first examining the role and opportunities of implementing green FinTech as a stimulus for transition towards green economic growth in African countries and, second, identifying knowledge gaps and future policy and research directions by developing an integrated framework to help African countries in the transition to green economic growth and green FinTech. The results illustrate an increasing trend in research attention towards the green FinTech concept and its relationship with green economic growth, climate change, and greening rules and standards. A deep inspection of the mined papers indicates that future research trajectories are oriented into five different mainstreams: technology and instruments in digital finance; regulation, policies, and green FinTech; climate risk mitigation through FinTech; FinTech and environmental quality; green finance and climate change mitigation. Based on these research directions, an integrated framework was conceptualised that aims to deliver green economic growth using FinTech as a vehicle of transition for African countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","African countries; bibliometric review; climate change; green economic growth; green FinTech; sustainability; systematic review","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Finance; Sustainable development; African country; Bibliometric; Bibliometric review; Economic growths; Green economic growth; Green economies; Green fintech; Industrial revolutions; Integrated frameworks; Systematic Review; Climate change","","","","Clim Change Secr Bonn Ger, (2015); Beckerman, Wilfred, Economic growth and the environment: Whose growth? whose environment?, World Development, 20, 4, pp. 481-496, (1992); Scientific American, (1993); Environmental Impacts of A North American Free Trade Agreement, (1991); Global Climate Risk Index 2021, (2021); Report of the Conference of the Parties on Its Fifteenth Session Held in Copenhagen from 7 to 19 December 2009, (2010); Fintech Revolution, (2018); Harnessing Digitalization in Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals Co Chairs Progress Report to the Secretary General of the Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals, (2019); Arner, Douglas W., Sustainability, FinTech and Financial Inclusion, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 1, pp. 7-35, (2020); Financial Stability Implications from Fintech, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142641561"

In cases such as Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) data sharing, when consent might not be enough, many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) still depend on contracts—a GDPR basis that is often overlooked due to its complexity. The contract’s lifecycle comprises many stages (e.g., drafting, negotiation, and signing) that must be executed in compliance with GDPR. Despite the active research efforts on digital contracts, contract-based GDPR compliance and challenges such as contract interoperability have not been sufficiently elaborated on yet. Since knowledge graphs and ontologies provide interoperability and support knowledge discovery, we propose and develop a knowledge graph-based tool for GDPR contract compliance verification (CCV). It binds GDPR’s legal basis to data sharing contracts. In addition, we conducted a performance evaluation in terms of execution time and test cases to validate CCV’s correctness in determining the overhead and applicability of the proposed tool in smart city and insurance application scenarios. The evaluation results and the correctness of the CCV tool demonstrate the tool’s practicability for deployment in the real world with minimum overhead. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data sharing; digital contracts; GDPR compliance; insurance; knowledge graph; ontology; smart cities","Compliance control; Contracts; Graphic methods; Interoperability; Knowledge graph; Life cycle; Smart city; Business-to-business; Compliance verification; Data Sharing; Digital contract; General data protection regulation compliance; General data protection regulations; Knowledge graphs; Ontology's; Regulation compliance; Research efforts; Ontology","","","This work is supported by the Horizon 2020 project smashHit (grant number 871477).","undefined; Proc Conf Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Life Sciences Swat4hcls 2018, (2018); Official Journal of the European Union Oj, (2016); Habib, Hana, Okay, whatever"": An Evaluation of Cookie Consent Interfaces, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2022); undefined; undefined; Li, He, The Impact of GDPR on Global Technology Development, Journal of Global Information Technology Management, 22, 1, pp. 1-6, (2019); Kurteva, Anelia, Consent through the lens of semantics: State of the art survey and best practices, Semantic Web, 15, 3, pp. 647-673, (2024); undefined; undefined","","MDPI","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140608442"

Turkey is one of the largest emerging market economies in the world with a strong banking system and high adoption of technology, so it has great potential to benefit from fintech solutions to boost sustainable finance. For the case analysis, the data used came from a research platform for a Turkish start-up ecosystem, Turkish regulations, and documents released on Turkey’s sustainable finance strategies by Turkish and international institutions. We found that Turkey has made remarkable progress in increasing financial inclusivity for underbanked individuals and SMEs via providing contactless payment and contract systems and microfinance by mobile carriers and other online platforms. Turkey was also able to promote the responsible consumption goal for sustainable development by improving fintech solutions on payment systems with educational content on this goal.

Both categories include state-owned banks, private banks with national capital, and private banks with foreign capital. The total number of bank branches within Turkey’s borders is 9663, so the average number of bank branches is approximately 190 per bank nationwide, located over 81 provinces []. Hence, most banks in Turkey heavily adopt traditional banking, i.e., with physical presence and branch operations. For Turkey, with the banking sector as the pillar of the financial system, lacking the ESG perspective in making financial decisions would create irreversible damage to economic indicators and can cause the system to collapse.

While research on the impact of tokenization on financial markets is extensive, literature provides virtually no description of mathematical models that can be used in the design and development of information systems issuing tokenized financial instruments. Thus, the study aims to develop mathematical models representing the transformation of the over-the-counter (OTC) securities market induced by the tokenization of underlying assets. The development of crowdlending platforms is gradually transforming the financial market landscape. The key change trends consist in transactional fragmentation both on the demand and supply sides. This paper proposes a mathematical model of internal transformation occurring in the OTC financial market, which describes the process of managing rights to underlying assets during their issuance and circulation. The model is built by analogy with the Harrison–Ruzzo–Ullman (HRU) model, applying the same principles to the relations of economic agents in exercising access rights to underlying assets as those that regulate access rights to files. The research novelty of the presented model consists in the formalization of financial market transformation occurring in the context of asset tokenization, which significantly expands the mathematical apparatus of digital financial transactions. This paper also proposes a mathematical model of competitive tokenization-induced transformation occurring in the OTC financial market, which describes transaction costs associated with attracting investment in the OTC financial market and the market for tokenized assets. In addition, the barriers of the OTC financial market and the stock market are described indicating the supply and demand trends in the context of transformation occurring in the OTC financial market under the influence of underlying asset tokenization. The novelty of this model lies in the mathematical formalization of the investment attraction process in the market for tokenized assets. The theoretical value of the developed models consists in the confirmation of significantly expanded supply capabilities of tokenized assets on the graph showing the dependence of asset returns on invested capital. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","asset tokenization; crowdlending; model; OTC securities market; transformation","","","","The article was prepared in accordance with the research plan of the Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (No. 0327-2021-0005).","Ullah, Assad, Exploring asymmetric relationship between Islamic banking development and economic growth in Pakistan: Fresh evidence from a non-linear ARDL approach, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 4, pp. 6168-6187, (2021); Ullah, Assad, Modeling the relationship between military spending and stock market development (a) symmetrically in China: An empirical analysis via the NARDL approach, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 554, (2020); Hein, Andreas, Digital platform ecosystems, Electronic Markets, 30, 1, pp. 87-98, (2020); Yonatany, Moshe, Platforms, ecosystems, and the internationalization of highly digitized organizations, Journal of Organization Design, 6, 1, (2017); Revista Brasileira De Inovacao, (2020); Kretschmer, Tobias, Platform ecosystems as meta-organizations: Implications for platform strategies, Strategic Management Journal, 43, 3, pp. 405-424, (2022); Riasanow, Tobias, Core, intertwined, and ecosystem-specific clusters in platform ecosystems: analyzing similarities in the digital transformation of the automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance and IIoT industry, Electronic Markets, 31, 1, pp. 89-104, (2021); Valente, Eduardo, Sharing economy: becoming an Uber driver in a developing country, Revista de Gestao, 26, 2, pp. 143-160, (2019); Popov, Evgeny Vasilievich, Mathematical support for financing social innovations, Mathematics, 8, 12, pp. 1-31, (2020); Nigmonov, Asror, FinTech and macroeconomics: Dataset from the US peer-to-peer lending platform, Data in Brief, 39, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139870300"

OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access control; Consortium blockchain; Data sharing; Identity management; Open banking; Privacy preservation; Smart contract","Application programming interfaces (API); Authentication; Authorization; Blockchain; Data integration; Data privacy; Data Sharing; Ecosystems; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document identification systems; Open Data; Web services; Block-chain; Consortium blockchain; Control framework; Decentralised; Identity management; Open banking; Privacy preservation; Third parties; Third-party service providers; Smart contract","","","This research was partially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under grant number 108-2511-H-009-009-MY3 .","API Economy and Digital Transformation in Financial Services the Case of Open Banking, (2017); Data Sharing and Open Banking, (2017); Chiu, Wayne Yang, My data, my control: A secure data sharing and access scheme over blockchain, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 63, (2021); Yeh, Loyao, SOChain: A Privacy-Preserving DDoS Data Exchange Service over SOC Consortium Blockchain, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 67, 4, pp. 1487-1500, (2020); Chang, Edward Y., DeepLinQ: Distributed multi-layer ledgers for privacy-preserving data sharing, pp. 173-178, (2019); IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, (2016); Bodkhe, Umesh, Blockchain for Industry 4.0: A comprehensive review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 79764-79800, (2020); Liu, Yang, Blockchain-based identity management systems: A review, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 166, (2020); Casino, Fran, A systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications: Current status, classification and open issues, Telematics and Informatics, 36, pp. 55-81, (2019); undefined, (2014)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0167739X","","FGCSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131444612"

Reverse factoring occurs when a buying firm offers a reduced short-term borrowing rate to a supplier company in exchange for longer payment terms. From the standpoint of a supplier, this paper investigates the impact of rating changes, interest rate fluctuations, and business cycle position on the cost-benefit trade-off in the SMEs and manufacturing companies. However, the data was collected using a questionnaire. The main result is that changes in critical financial variables like ratings, news alerts and interest rates will shift former win–win circumstances for the supplier dependent on the business cycle into win–lose situations for the supplier. Overall, the reverse factoring results reveal sophisticated trade-offs, necessitating careful consideration in managerial decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Interest Rates; Reverse Factoring; SMEs; Supply Chain Finance and Manufacturing Companies","","","","","Abbasi, Kashif Raza, Asymmetric impact of renewable and non-renewable energy on the industrial sector in Pakistan: Fresh evidence from Bayesian and non-linear ARDL, Renewable Energy, 187, pp. 944-957, (2022); Almatarneh, Zeyad, The role of management accounting in the development of supply chain performance in logistics manufacturing companies, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 10, 1, pp. 13-18, (2022); Alzaqebah, Malek, Memory based cuckoo search algorithm for feature selection of gene expression dataset, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 24, (2021); Alzaqebah, Malek, Improved Multi-Verse Optimizer Feature Selection Technique with Application to Phishing, Spam, and Denial of Service Attacks, International Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security, 13, 1, pp. 76-81, (2021); Alzaqebah, Malek, Hybrid feature selection method based on particle swarm optimization and adaptive local search method, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 2414-2422, (2021); Ayoush, Maha D., The Impact of Mergers on the Financial Performance of Jordanian Public Shareholding Companies, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 7, 10, pp. 751-759, (2020); Bandyopadhyay, Arindam, Factors determining capital structure and corporate performance in India: Studying the business cycle effects, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 61, pp. 160-172, (2016); Begenau, Juliane, Capital requirements, risk choice, and liquidity provision in a business-cycle model, Journal of Financial Economics, 136, 2, pp. 355-378, (2020); Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, (2025); Beyer, Hans Martin, Supply chain finance: cost–benefit differentials under reverse factoring with extended payment terms, International Journal of Financial Studies, 9, 4, (2021)","","Growing Science","","","","","","22916822; 22916830","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137322545"

This is regardless of the size of the business and includes new and fledgling ones. Despite this, it is almost impossible for banks to understand whether an SME has a good credit status due to increased information asymmetry. This could, therefore, prevent banks from lending money to an SME. Having seen their financing contract after the 2007–2009 financial crisis, American SMEs have lost even more market share for business loans. The Small Business Credit Survey by the Federal Reserve showed that “small employer companies” (firms with at least one non-owner employee, but fewer than 500) in the US had the most frequent financial challenge. Just 42% of these firms had their financing requirements fulfilled. Thus, the study findings confirmed the nexus between the variables. Financing shortages are detrimental to SMEs and have been shown to keep them from reaching their full potential to expand and provide economic benefits.

Traditional centralized marketplaces are unable to meet the needs of a transparent, safe, and privacy-protected data marketplace. To address the above challenges, we propose a data marketplace on blockchain with arbitration using side-contracts mechanisms (dMOBAs), in which a consortium of data owners, data buyers, and arbitrators collaborate to create an ecosystem in the blockchain's witnesses. Our marketplace's goals are to provide a decentralized platform for trading personal data for both service providers and data owners. In the meantime, the transaction method can be arbitrated. The arbitrators alliance, which is responsible for resolving data disputes, is formed by a service provider jointly nominated by the buyer and seller. The integrity and value of transacted data can be validated thanks to the arbitrators’ consortium. The side-contracts concept decreases the public chain's overhead and enhances the marketplace's operating efficiency. The marketplace's orderly functioning is ensured by explicit incentives and rigorous arbitration methods. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the mechanisms, we implement dMOBAs on Ethereum, Fabric and IPFS platforms and analyze its performance. According to the testing results, our arbitration method is 2 times faster than full public chain-based arbitration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Data marketplace; Distributed storage network; Encrypted search; Smart contract","Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Efficiency; Internet service providers; Block-chain; Buyers and sellers; Centralised; Data driven; Data marketplaces; Decentralised; Distributed storage networks; Encrypted searches; Service data; Service provider; Smart contract","","","This research is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2018YFB1402703 .

It is important for decision makers how critical these routes are concerning risks. Within the scope of the study, determining the risks, the weights of these risks, and high-risk routes accordingly are discussed. The literature review related to the problem is first consulted. After the literature review, interviews are made with experts on their subject. The main criteria and sub-criteria to define the risks are determined. Then, these criteria are weighted by the Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (IVIF-AHP), and risk assessment is made to alternative routes based on these weighted risks. The routes are evaluated by Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (IVIF-TOPSIS) methodology, and thus, it is determined which route has the highest risk and which route has the lowest risk.

Design/methodology/approach: The study has adopted a qualitative research methodology, using three approaches, namely, a survey of the literature to identify the research gap and the variables needed for developing the model, content analysis to construct the variables into a model and semi-structured interview with 10 experts in banking, Sharīʿah and Financial Technology (FinTech) to validate the SFMCF model. Findings: The major findings of the study lie in developing the SFMCF model for Islamic banking, empirical validation of the model’s viability and acceptability and the implications for the main stakeholders of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: The SFMCF model is specific to Islamic banking and its validation is based on the views of 10 experts. Practical implications: The SFMCF would necessitate changes to the central bank regulatory framework, convince Islamic banks to forego their powers and advantages of creating money and enhance their abilities to fully adopt Sharīʿah-compliant FinTech. Social implications: The proposed model if implemented would change positively the perception of the society particularly the stakeholders of Islamic banks and restore their trust and confidence about the direction of the institution toward achieving the Sharīʿah objectives.

In this study, several potential application areas of blockchain with promising benefits have been identified in the natural gas industry. There is no single solution that can address different challenges and meet disparate requirements. Therefore, it is important to understand the needs of the natural gas industry and propose appropriate blockchain solutions. Moreover, in the literature, there is a lack of detailed case studies involving industrial experts from the natural gas sector. Expert opinion can be useful for prioritizing the most needed or expected blockchain application areas among several options. By considering privacy, authentication, speed, security, energy consumption, and costs, suitable blockchain types and consensus mechanisms can be determined. This study presents one of the first detailed case studies for tailored applications of blockchain in the natural gas industry. Through a two-staged semi-structured interview with executives from SOCAR Azerbaijan, the most important blockchain application areas and operational requirements were identified. Furthermore, the most suitable blockchain solutions that can address application-specific conditions and needs were determined. This study both, develops a replicable and reliable methodology to conduct detailed blockchain implementation case studies in the natural gas industry and various other sectors, and provides detailed insights into the primary application areas, operational expectations–requirements, and implementation challenges specific to each application. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; case study; engineering; internet of things (IoT); natural gas","Blockchain; Energy utilization; Gas industry; Gases; Natural gas; Application area; Azerbaijan; Block-chain; Case-studies; Energy consumption and cost; Expert opinion; Gas sector; Internet of thing; Natural Gas Industry; Semi structured interviews; Internet of things","","","","Natural Gas Information Overview, (2018); Electrical Infromation Overview Electricity Production, (2021); Miao, Yiming, Blockchain and AI-Based Natural Gas Industrial IoT System: Architecture and Design Issues, IEEE Network, 34, 5, pp. 84-90, (2020); Blockchain can Help Transform Supply Chain Networks in the Chemicals and Petroleum Industry, (2018); Petroleum Business Review, (2020); Hype Cycle for Blockchain Business Shows Blockchain Will have A Transformational Impact Across Industries in Five to 10 Years, (2019); Digital Transformation Initiative Oil and Gas Industry, (2017); Yesilot Zehir, Songül, Internet of Things in Blockchain Ecosystem from Organizational and Business Management Perspectives, Contributions to Management Science, pp. 47-62, (2020); Brookbanks, Mike, The impact of a blockchain platform on trust in established relationships: a case study of wine supply chains, Supply Chain Management, 27, 7, pp. 128-146, (2022); Aslam, Javed, Factors influencing blockchain adoption in supply chain management practices: A study based on the oil industry, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 6, 2, pp. 124-134, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137652731"

It is assumed that the adoption of cryptocurrencies would continue to increase. The role of the dependent variables of social influence (SI), transparency (TR), price value (PV), traceability (TRA), and attitude (AT) was examined to identify customer satisfaction as a mediator variable for cryptocurrency adoption. Random sampling was used to ensure that the research objectives were adequately examined. A total of 295 respondents answered the survey questions intended for cryptocurrency users in Malaysia. Data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-LSM). The findings revealed that SI, PV, TRA, and AT were all impactful in terms of AD (dependent variable) through the mediation of customer satisfaction in Malaysia's digital market. However, TR negatively impacts Malaysia's digital market. Future researchers in other regions and industries may be able to reproduce these findings and use similar constructs to add to the present body of knowledge.

We proposed a theoretical model by combining the technology paradox framework and self-efficacy theory. There were 418 valid questionnaires collected via an online survey. This study demonstrates, using structural equation modeling (SEM), that self-efficacy significantly affects technology paradoxes, anxiety, and resistance. Moreover, it suggests that the relationship between technology paradoxes and anxiety varies, and users are more concerned about the dissatisfiers of technology paradoxes (inefficiency and public). Besides, a positive correlation was found between anxiety and resistance. Finally, the results of the mediating effects test show that self-efficacy can not only directly affect resistance, but also indirectly influence it through efficiency, public, and anxiety.

This study employs two-stage least square (2SLS) methods on the annual data of 217 Islamic banks from 35 countries ranging from 2010 to 2019. We find that the relationship between risk-based capital and risk-taking behaviour is negative, and the results are heterogeneous across different regions concerning both signs and significance. Consistent with the theory of moral hazard, we find the negative relationship between risk-based capital and Islamic banks’ risk-taking behaviour, implying that managers in Islamic banks could increase their investment in risky assets and keep only smaller amounts of capital. The concept of profit and loss sharing motivates them to take a higher risk and aim to get a higher yield. This relationship is also in line with the agency theory, inferring that bank managers could take excessive risk to get higher compensation to align with higher profitability. The results also reveal a positive relationship between risk-taking and profitability, which is in line with the portfolio theory in finance. The findings in our paper would be useful for decision-makers and bank managers in understanding the interrelationship between risk, capital, and profitability and no factor alone could be good enough to ensure bank soundness. Furthermore, our findings imply that regulators and bank managers should not only focus on bank capital for increasing banks’ stability. They should also look into both profitability and capital ratios in addition to bank capital because all three factors could increase banks’ stability simultaneously. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic banks; profitability; risk-based capital; risk-taking","","","","anonymous referees for their helpful comments which help to improve our manuscript significantly.

Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory qualitative study whereby the data are obtained from library research and empirical studies. As for empirical data, it is sourced from semi-structured interviews with three types of groups: the book industry, the crowdfunding platform and Shari’ah experts. Findings: The study found that mudharabah crowdfunding could overcome the book publishing industry’s financial problems. However, this requires special requirements for applicants (writers or publishers) to avoid fraudulent cases, as well as committed management in running the platform and a substantial crowd of loyal funders to maintain the platform. Simultaneously, even though mudharabah is a risky instrument, the risk can be mitigated by closely monitoring the progress of the project. As a result, this study proposes a special framework for mudharabah based crowdfunding to fund self-publishers and small publishers in Malaysia. Research limitations/implications: This is an exploratory study, in which its findings may not be generalised due to the limited number of participants. Practical implications: A special model for mudharabah based crowdfunding can be established through an online platform to support book publishing in Malaysia. Social implications: As this mudharabah crowdfunding model has the potential to support the book industry financially, it could also nurture talented young writers while also preserving knowledge. Originality/value: This study highlights a fresh and in-depth discussion both in theory and practice in proposing a special Islamic crowdfunding framework based on mudharabah as an alternative fund for the book industry, particularly to support self- and small publishers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Book industry; Book publishing; Crowdfunding; Islamic crowdfunding; Mudharabah","","","","The Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia fully funds this research under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme for Research Acculturation of Early Career Researchers entitled “Developing “FundMyBook” model based on Mudharabah Crowdfunding Platform as a Capital Source for Books Publication” (RACER/1/2019/SS01/UNISZA//3).","Islam and Civilisational Renewal, (2016); Malaysian Journal of Media Studies, (2016); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); Haqbah Lib Alilm Al Iqtidiyah, (2011); Fiqh Al Islami Wa Adillatuhu, (2006); European Journal of Business and Management, (2014); Islmiyyt, (2018); Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce, (2019); Bade, Marco, Bargaining over crowdfunding benefits, Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy, 7, 2, pp. 166-177, (2018)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17590841; 17590833","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107396900"

Global adoption of fintech is rapidly increasing due to its disruptive nature and is largely embraced by participants who are underserved by traditional financial service providers. Global investments in fintech are growing rapidly year by year owing to increased interconnectivity with the digital revolution. Fintech is expansive, engulfing a plethora of innovative applications in various services including payments, financing, asset management, insurance, etc. There exists a gap in the literature and visualization research on impact and future pathway of fintech innovations in payments and financial services and role of financial regulations. This study aims to enrich the understanding of fintech innovations in payments and financing and investigate the correlation and significance of regulatory framework in maintaining a fair ecosystem. With this objective, an extant systematic review was performed using research articles published in peer-reviewed journals for the period 2014–2022 when there has been a burgeoning of interest in ‘fintech’ globally. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical constructs of fintech innovations in the financial services industry and show that such innovations play a crucial role in shaping the nature of future of business.

The present research aimed at exploring the underlying determinant factors that shape the investors’ intentions to fund in a crowdfunding platform, a phenomenon still under-researched in the developing world. To bridge this void in the literature, we investigated how calculus and relational trust mediate the effects of perceived accreditation, blockchain technology, structural assurance, and third-party seal on the investors’ intention using the SEM technique to analyze the data collected from 110 platform investors in Pakistan. Findings suggest that third-party seal and blockchain technology strongly influence the calculus trust. While the investors’ intention to invest is mediated by calculus trust, the relational trust fails to show any mediation effect, suggesting that investors make investment decisions based on what makes sense to them cognitively instead of affectively.

The increase in NFT transactions has drawn the attention of the art market to the consequent carbon emissions resulting from verifying transactions in proof-of-work blockchains supporting NFT transactions. With CO<inf>2</inf>-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-of-work blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols. Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains. Linking the damage caused by proof-of-work blockchains to climate change and human mortality, this study examines the recent policy interventions designed to motivate a shift in blockchain consensus protocols and promote miners' energy efficiency to mitigate environmental damage.

Cash waqf has gained huge attention in Indonesia because of its flexibility, especially after the Majlis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) officially announcing in 2002 that cash waqf practices in the country are Sharīʿah-compliant. Millennials comprise 33.75% of the total Indonesian population. Therefore, it is vital to analyze cash waqf from an Indonesian perspective. This study provides vital information for all institutions that are concerned with the enhancement of cash waqf contributions in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Self-structured questionnaires were distributed in Java Island to collect the data. The data were examined by employing suitable statistical tools. Besides, post-interview fact-finding was conducted with cash waqf experts from different related institutions in Indonesia to reach a more in-depth understanding about cash waqf issues. Findings: The results depict a high level of awareness about cash waqf among millennials in Indonesia. The results further reveal a lower willingness level to contribute to cash waqf of the sample population as compared to their level of awareness about cash waqf. Moreover, cash waqf promotions must focus on delivering a deeper understanding about the concept and how it differs from other types of Islamic philanthropy. The results suggest that waqf trustees in the country must be more transparent. Moreover, the Indonesian Waqf Board should implement stricter rules to monitor waqf trustees. Research limitations/implications: This research restricts the sample population to Indonesian Muslims who were born between 1980 and 2000. Practical implications: As a Muslim-majority country, one would expect Indonesia to make much progress in cash waqf. By providing an explanatory understanding of willingness and awareness of cash waqf among Indonesians, this research can be helpful in designing proper educative marketing campaigns for future endowers to cash waqf activities to ensure cash waqf institutions provide efficient services. It is advisable to emphasize the transparency of waqf organizations. This will add to the nāz˙irs’ (waqf trustee) reputation, thereby boosting waqf's national shares by ensuring a proper allocation of cash waqf.

The revolution of the internet and smartphones has changed human life, as happens in smart contracts. This difference in character between smart and conventional contracts has not been fully anticipated by applicable law. That is why the urgency of fiqh renewal or reform of the law in the cyberspace era. Although smart contracts are still in their infancy, and there are still many critical issues that need to be resolved, the results of the literature research show that the smart contract has fulfilled the principles in the agreement/contract in Islamic law. According to the ITE Law, a smart contract can be interpreted as an agreement referred to in Article 1313 of the Civil Code, ""an act where one person binds himself to one or more other people"". Although this study is not sufficient, this needs to be elaborated from the perspective of Indonesian law. The most important things in smart contracts to comply with the Islamic law are: the sequence of processes in the smart contract must comply with Islamic law, the object being transacted must be halal, the perpetrators have complied with the provisions of the Islamic law, fixed price during the contract period and the number of parties involved in the contract may increase over time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","block chain; Indonesian law; Islamic law; Smart contract","","","","","Al Buyu Ash Syaia Wa Asar Dawabit Al Mabi Ala Syariyyatiha, (1998); Blockchain Based Smart Contracts A Systematic Mapping Study, (2017); International Journal of Advanced Research, (2020); Journal of Lex Generalis Jls, (2021); Plas 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security Co Located with Ccs 2016; Capgemini Consulting, (2016); Chen, Ting, Under-optimized smart contracts devour your money, pp. 442-446, (2017); Delmolino, Kevin, Step by step towards creating a safe smart contract: Lessons and insights from a cryptocurrency lab, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9604 LNCS, pp. 79-94, (2016); Mudah Dan Bijak Memahami Masalah Akad Syariah, (2011); Hukum Perkawinan Islam Di Indonesia, (2006)","","State Institute for Islamic Studies Curup","","","","","","25483374; 25483382","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163801187"

Hadiths are an example of one of the historical texts that should be securely preserved. Due to the expansion of the online resources, fabrications and alterations of fake Hadiths are easily feasible. Therefore, it has become more challenging to authenticate the online available Hadith contents and much harder to keep these authenticated results secure and unmanipulated. In this research, we are using the capabilities of the distributed blockchain technology to securely archive the Hadith and its level of authenticity in a blockchain. We selected a permissioned blockchain customized model in which the main entities approving the level of authenticity of the Hadith are well-established and specialized institutions in the main Islamic countries that can apply their own Hadith validation model. The proposed solution guarantees its integrity using the crowd wisdom represented in the selected nodes in the blockchain, which uses voting algorithms to decide the insertion of any new Hadiths into the database. This technique secures data integrity at any given time. If any organization’s credentials are compromised and used to update the data maliciously, 50% + 1 approval from the whole network nodes will be required.

Therefore, the motivation of this research is to investigate the perceptions of Shari'ah scholars and financial experts on the concepts and salient features of Shari'ah-compliant precious metal backed crypto-currency (PMC). To achieve this, this study adopted a qualitative method using semi-structured interview based on saturation technique. The results from Shari'ah advisors and financial experts indicated that the informants have differences of views on the assets-backed money, but they agreed that it ensures stability of money and adding the cryptocurrency technology is found to be desirable and recommendable. It is also found that PMC would be subjected to financial regulation challenges and using blockchain technology will increase the transparency. The informants agreed that PMC is closer to Maq sid al-Shari'ah and there is some form of justice and equality compared to the current interest-based financial system. Therefore, the informants recommended the implementation of PMC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cryptocurrency; perceptions; precious metal; Shari'ah oriented","currency; financial market; implementation process; Internet; investment; metal; perception; technological development","","","","Accounting Auditing and Governance Standards, (2015); Shari Ah Standards for Islamic Financial Institutions, (2017); Diminishing Partnership as an Alternative Islamic Home Financing in Malaysia Issues and Perceptions, (2011); Al Shajarah Journal of the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization Istac, (2015); Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Islamic Currency, (2016); Ihya Ulum Ud Din, (2004); Fatwa on the Islamic Ruling on Cryptocurrency, (2018); Bezemer, Dirk J., Schumpeter might be right again: the functional differentiation of credit, Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 24, 5, pp. 935-950, (2014); Bank Negara Malaysia Issues Policy Document for Digital Currencies, (2018)","","World Scientific","","","","","","02175908; 17936837","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090561764"

It has served to cater to the capital requirements of big corporations and governments, while circumventing interest to adhere to the Shariah law. Sukuk can be touted as Shariah-compliant bonds that rank among the most successful and the fastest growing financial instrument in the Islamic economy. The sukuk research area is marked by a dearth of quantitative literature, compared to qualitative academic work. This paper seeks to fill this existing gap, and introduces a novel, exploratory analysis of sukuk tokenization based on a case study. The funding needs of small and medium enterprises remains largely unmet through sukuk on account of the high costs involved, among other reasons. As we show in this paper, blockchains can aid to lower the cost incurred through the tokenization of sukuk. We highlight some of the key challenges involved in the issuance of sukuk and discuss their resolution using blockchain. We also provide a taxonomy of blockchain applications in finance, with a particular focus on Islamic finance. Our paper reviews different blockchain architectures to assess their viability for tokenization. We conduct a novel case study on sukuk tokenization by implementing a basic smart contract for Sukuk al-Murabaha on Ethereum. The paper concludes by a conceptual analysis of feasibility concerns, based on a comparison of the conducted cost-benefit analysis of conventional sukuk issuance with tokenization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cost-benefit analysis; Ethereum; Smart contract; Sukuk; Tokenization","","","","This work is funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under its AFR-PPP Programme, which is aimed at providing PhD and Post Doc grants for innovation and industry partnerships under grant number FNR11617092 .","Agbo, Cornelius Chidubem, Blockchain technology in healthcare: A systematic review, Healthcare (Switzerland), 7, 2, (2019); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2020); Almadhoun, Randa, A User Authentication Scheme of IoT Devices using Blockchain-Enabled Fog Nodes, Proceedings of IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA, 2018-November, (2018); undefined, (2019); Amazon Ec2 Reserved Instances Pricing, (2019); Bartoletti, Massimo, An Empirical analysis of smart contracts: Platforms, applications, and design patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10323 LNCS, pp. 494-509, (2017); Chaer, Abdulla, Blockchain for 5G: Opportunities and challenges, (2019); Chauhan, Anamika, Blockchain and Scalability, pp. 122-128, (2018); Chiu, Jonathan, Blockchain-Based Settlement for Asset Trading, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1716-1753, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","10440283","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085772061"

The main part of the focus, first, Securities Commission Malaysia has divided digital currencies into two categories, namely digital currencies based on technology without underlying assets and the ones based on riba goods. For the former currencies, it is categorized as urudh and is not considered a currency from sharia point of view, nor it is a riba commodity. Second, Based on Islamic law, the use of digital payment applications between Malaysia and Indonesia is permissible. Riba issues can occur if the floating funds stored at the service provider are used improperly. Floating funds should not get any additional to avoid riba. Lucky draws and lottery given after doing top-up are riba because of the uncertainty.

Due to crowdfunding, the way the products are brought into the market by entrepreneurs and established companies has been changed. Most companies are turning to crowdfunding in order to enhance research development and innovation. Since 2019, Bahrain is home to a debt-based crowdfunding platform. A great example of finance raised through crowdfunding would be that of Oculus VR, well known for virtual reality. Oculus was funded through Kickstarter which is among the leading crowdfunding platforms. The resultant capital was tenfold higher than the target investment [149]. Islamic finance can highly benefit from this because it satisfies the basic principle of sharia-compliant banking. Crowdfunding doesn’t involve interest payments and is done to support small or medium sized business who would otherwise be excluded [150], [151]. The investors of a crowdfunding project are collectively sharing profits and the risk is low because it is diversified among them. Islamic crowdfunding would require investment in halal projects and would be extremely suitable to the millions of Muslims who struggle to raise capital to start a business [150], [152]. Crowdfunding would also satisfy the Islamic rule of being socially responsible by supporting a business and in turn profiting together without the loss of another [153]. The Central Bank of Bahrain has launched traditional and sharia-compliant crowdfunding for small and medium sized enterprises. However, even with government initiatives, crowdfunding hasn’t raised a lot of demand. This could be due to inadequate awareness, lack of technical knowledge and slow electronic process [154]. Nevertheless, Islamic crowdfunding is a valuable program for creative entrepreneurs which gives them a way out of the traditional financing methods and consists of less risk. Initiatives must be put in place to encourage sharia-compliant crowdfunding for those who are unaware and might be in need. Government can ease the procedures involved and pace up the process. There must be a push in this direction of financing in the Islamic world to lift small & medium businesses and promote collective well-being.

Though organizations' management have adopted measures prescribed by the literature, these measures have been unable to provide a fit-for-all solution. This has motivated this study to re-examine the organizational resilience factors driving operational performance in the post-pandemic era, specifically in consideration of the role of firm industry orientation and firm size. Thus, the preset study aims it to identify to what extent the organizational resilience (ability, adaptability, agility and flexibility) effects the operational performance; and, to determine how the firm size influence the relationship between organizational resilience and the operational performance of the manufacturing and service sectors. Data was collected from 85 organizations in the Malaysian manufacturing and services industries and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results show that the agility and flexibility dimensions of resilience have a significant positive effect on operational performance, while the ability and adaptability dimensions have no such effect. Additionally, firm size was found to be insignificant in the relationship between organizational resilience and operational performance. The findings reveal that resilience is vital for the sustainability of an organization in this turbulent and complex business climate. Therefore, managers should thus consider incorporating appropriate resilience strategies in both opportunities and operations to embrace different strategies to leverage organizational resilience post COVID. Ultimately, the government should utilize these findings for policymaking when leading post-COVID-19 projects and initiatives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","manufacturing and services industries; operational performance; Organizational resilience; PLS-SEM; post-COVID-19","","","","The researchers thank all the participants (managers) who responded to the questionnaire within a short period despite their busy schedules.

The study uses the Global Financial Development Indicators Data from 2011, 2014, and 2018 published by the World bank. Graphical trend analysis, covariance, and correlation analysis are used to examine the role of digital payments, the use of the credit card, and use of the debit card to find out their impact on Fintech and the distribution of credit to the private sector. The results suggest that the use of financial technology is increasing in the GCC region, and the use of digital payments, debit cards, and credit cards have a linear dependence on each other and positively contribute to the distribution of credit to the private sector – hence, to financial intermediation in certain aspects. The results also show that Saudi Arabia is ranked four among six regional economies in terms of the use of digital finance. It is also observed that the country has potential for Fintech growth both in terms of supply and demand. To tap into this potential, regulators have introduced a regulatory sandbox to facilitate Fintech startups. Based on the evaluation, cooperation among traditional financial institutions, Fintech startups, technology companies, regulators, and academia could reduce the potential challenges and enhance Fintech in Saudi Arabia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial intermediation; Fintech; Saudi Arabia","","","","This research has been funded by the Scientific Research Deanship at the University of Ha’il-Saudi Arabia through project number GR-22 047.","Allen, Franklin, The theory of financial intermediation, Journal of Banking and Finance, 21, 11-12, pp. 1461-1485, (1997); Allen, Franklin, What do financial intermediaries do?, Journal of Banking and Finance, 25, 2, pp. 271-294, (2001); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Fintech Law Reporter, (2015); Boot, Arnoud W.

An interpretative qualitative research approach is employed, with case studies of Malaysian public university waqf administrators, and data analysis is performed using open, axial, and selective coding. The findings suggest that in terms of coercive isomorphism there are two transparency challenges related to blockchain solutions in the waqf management system: 1) errors in the issuance of receipts (process), which are expected to be overcome by blockchain solutions in the form of individual network technology and ID identifiers; and 2) difficulties in waqf distribution (process), which are predicted to be solved by blockchain solutions in the form of controlling tools, public ledgers, and obtaining waqf distribution data. In normative isomorphism, there are two accountability challenges with blockchain solutions in the waqf management system: 1) difficulties in controlling waqf activities (process), which are expected to be overcome by blockchain solutions which allow internal control; and 2) decisions on waqf distribution (output), which should be solved by blockchain solutions which allow awareness among stakeholders of waqf distribution. In mimetic isomorphism, there is one accountability challenge in the process which has blockchain solutions in the waqf management system, namely system integration, which is predicted to be overcome by a blockchain solution related to traceability.

As such, Bitcoin is among the zakatable assets since it meets the conditions of zakat on assets. Moreover, Bitcoin as a digital currency would also be zakatable if a country recognises it as currency, as would any regulated digital currency issued by a government.

The hierarchy effects of the advertisement state that customers go through the process from product unawareness to product purchase. In crowdfunding, project owners have to present the product to the customers in a similar way a marketer markets its product. Thus AIDA model of advertising has been applied to crowdfunded projects, and it is discussed how, at different phases of crowdfunding, the AIDA model can be useful for project owners to take backers from unawareness to finally contributing towards it.

Design/methodology/approach: This study was designed as a conceptual research model to verify the mediating effect of integration and collaboration in the relationship trust and relationship commitment and supply chain performance. In order to design a conceptual research model, a total 30 items were investigated and the SEM method was verified using six observations variables Findings: According to this study, it was found that financial and non-financial performance of companies adopting Korea's supply chain management increased when trust and relationship commitment were strengthened with partner companies. In particular, in the relationship between trust of supply chain management and supply chain management performance, integration with partner companies contributed to increase financial performance, but did not make a positive contribution to non-financial performance. On the other hand, in the relationship between supply chain management's relationship commitment and supply chain management, collaboration made a positive contribution to increasing financial and non-financial performance. What this study means is that higher trust and relationship commitment with partner companies in supply chain management contributed to a direct influence on financial and non-financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study used the citation count to measure the effect of trust and relationship on supply chain performance. While this serves the purpose of this study, citation counts may not perfectly represent the value and impact of a study. The findings of this study provide a guide post for future studies.

Findings from our review show that the practitioner-oriented literature foreshadowed the rise of FinTech by extensively reporting on algorithm-based and electronic trading (2009 onwards), followed by reporting on FinTech start-ups and funding successes (2014 onwards). The practitioner literature subsequently reported on alternative finance models, the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and risks and regulatory issues. Academic literature on FinTech began to rise from 2014 onwards, focusing initially on the development of FinTech in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending. However, the body of work at the intersection of FinTech and IS is still small. Our review sheds light on several opportunities for future research, including financial inclusion, the impacts arising from COVID-19, and the emergence of new business models, such as Banking as a Service (BaaS). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AlgoTrading; Banking as a Service (BaaS); COVID-19; Cryptocurrency; Financial Inclusion; Literature Review; Machine-based Learning; RegTech; Research Trends; Risk and Regulation","Electronic money; Finance; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Peer to peer networks; Risk assessment; Algotrading; Banking as a service (baa); Financial inclusions; Literature reviews; Machine-based learning; Regtech; Regulatory issues; Research trends; Risk and regulation; Risk issues; COVID-19","","","Martina Linnenluecke is Professor of Environmental Finance and leads the Center for Corporate Sustainability and Environmental Finance at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.

The collected data then is analytically and critically examined using content analysis method. The article finds that the successful and effective establishment of e-arbitration in Malaysia requires the fulfilment of several non-legal requirements. Some of the non-legal requirements are in place with a need for improvements. In contrast, other non-legal requirements need to be appropriately addressed. For this reason, this article provides a range of recommendations that would provide the relevant authorities in Malaysia with valuable insight on how to satisfy these non-legal requirements.

In 1792 in America, the official price of gold was USD 19.3939/oz, whilst in 2021 the average market price of gold is about USD 1,800/oz, thus one dollar in 1792 is now only worth 1 cent in 2021 (19.3939/1,800). Most of this devaluation occurred since 1971, which represents a catastrophic collapse in the store of value function of money over the past fifty years, confirming a failure in contemporary monetary theory and policy in achieving monetary and price stability under the fiat standard. The loss of purchasing power as a result of this devaluation is so profound that the associated confiscation of wealth, due to inflation, has undermined all wealth creation in real terms. Fiat currencies have now discovered their true intrinsic wealth and are essentially worthless. By conducting a survey of classical Islamic literature, this study seeks to re-examine our understanding of money to encourage monetary reform to develop future solutions, given the failure of the fiat standard in satisfying the objectives of the sharīʿah (maqasid al-sharīʿah) in terms of protection of wealth (hifiz al-māl) and imparting social justice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic economics; Islamic monetary theory; maqasid al-sharīʿah; monetary economics","","","","","Abdullah, Adam, Economic security requires monetary and price stability: Analysis of Malaysian macroeconomic and credit data, Al-Shajarah, 20, Specialissue, pp. 205-247, (2015); Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Abdullah, Adam, Examining US approvals of Islamic financing products and the Islamic theory of lawful profit, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 9, 4, pp. 532-550, (2016); Islamic Currency, (2016); Abdullah, Adam, Towards stabilization of the World Monetary System: A Shariah Perspective, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 30, 2, pp. 71-78, (2017); Money and the Real Economy an Islamic Perspective, (2018); Islamic Economics, (2018); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2018); International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Studies, (2020); Abdullah, Adam, Modern Monetary Theory or Islamic Monetary Theory of Value?

The rules imposed by the Financial Services Authority (FSA/ Otoritas Jasa Keuangan/OJK) have aspects of riba that contradict sharia compliance principles. This study determines alternative solutions to unfair practices in conventional Fintech, especially peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) in Indonesian banking practices. The research uses normative and empirical methods with statutory and empirical data from library research and interviews. The study shows the presence of economic immorality in conventional P2P loan practices, such as maisyir, gharar, riba, dzalim, and haram, which are contrary to Islamic principles. This necessitates the application of primary sharia principles in sharia fintech. Thus, Islamic P2P Lending is an alternative solution to Islamic banking’s financial technology practices for customers using conventional fintech services. This is due to challenges in conventional fintech, including illegal fintech, intimidation in debt financing, high-interest rates, and the use of unlawful personal data. Therefore, the principles of sharia compliance and good faith are alternative solutions to strengthen sharia fintech and protect consumers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative solutions; Indonesia; Islamic fintech; P2P lending","","","","The authors express gratitude to the Institute for Research, Community Service, and Publications of the Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta for its funding and the Grant for Scientific Publication support in this series of international scientific journals.","Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); Academia Edu; Global Journal of Finance and Management, (2016); undefined, (2007); Kepatuhan Syariah Di Lembaga Keuangan Syariah Lks Optimalkah from Dakwatuna Com, (2017); Apa Itu Industri Financial Technology Fintech Indonesia, (2016); Fong, Adrian, Regulation of peer-to-peer lending in Hong Kong: State of play, Law and Financial Markets Review, 9, 4, pp. 251-259, (2015); An Introduction to Islamic Economics and Finance, (2005); undefined","","Universiti Utara Malaysia Press","","","","","","2229984X; 01279483","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124526163"

Cryptocurrencies have received significant attention in recent years. This focus has obscured the real technical innovation in data storage and retention – that of the so-called ‘blockchain’ digital architecture. Blockchain – also known as ‘distributed ledger technology’ (DLT) – has the potential to change much more than the realm of conventional financial services. The ability to transfer, store and record non-fungible bits of information is an important technical accomplishment that brings the economic dynamics of supply and demand to the digital sphere.

When performing a comparative analysis of the levels of financial inclusion in Africa, we mobilize the principal component analysis methodology to build the African Financial Inclusion Index (AFIndex). To test the empirical validity of the analytical conclusions, we use a panel data regression technique on a database constituted of 33 African countries over the period 2004–2019. Based on model simulations, financial inclusion stimulates investment and economic growth. Empirical results provide evidence attesting to the fact that financial inclusion has a significant and positive impact on investment and economic growth in Africa. The AFIndex shows that most African economies have a low level of financial inclusion. Our model is original as it provides analytical evidence on the negative impact of financial exclusion on economic growth, emphasizing the vital role of financial inclusion for economic growth. The AFIndex is a useful tool for designing and evaluating policies and/or programs intended for promoting financial inclusion in Africa. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Africa; African Financial Inclusion Index; contract enforceability; economic growth; financial frictions; Financial inclusion; institutional failures; investment; panel data; principal component analysis","comparative study; economic growth; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; investment; Africa","","","The authors sincerely thank the two anonymous reviewers for their comments that contributed to the improvement and clarification of this paper.

In order to safeguard the assimilation of the technology into the existing traditional practice of Islamic finance, Shariah-compliant regulation is, therefore, necessary for governing the potential risks associated throughout the process of financial activities.

This study considers several insightful theories, including Stakeholder Theory, Agency Theory, and the TOE Framework, to understand the relationships and drivers of sustainability reporting. The study examines Indonesian Islamic corporates using data from the ISSI (Indonesia Shariah Stock Index). We gathered annual reports and sustainability reports from the ISSI database for the year 2019. The study investigates how human governance (HG), Islamic corporate governance (ICG), and information technology usage (ITU) are related to sustainability reporting disclosure (SR). The findings showed that the sustainability reporting disclosure was significantly influenced by human governance and Islamic corporate governance with firm size and leverage. Furthermore, the research showed that profitability was not significantly related to sustainability reporting disclosure, that Islamic corporate governance had a significant negative influence on SR, and that IT usage was only significant when human governance was not present. Finally, the results showed that human governance is the main driver of sustainability reporting disclosure. Therefore, we conclude that human governance is the best predictor for sustainability reporting disclosure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate governance; Digitalization; Human governance; IT usage; Sustainability reporting disclosure","developing world; governance approach; information technology; profitability; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; Indonesia","","","Funding: The authors disclose receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Farmers are often reluctant to be covered for their crops due to lack of trust in insurance firms and the fear of delayed or non-payment of claims. In this paper, a blockchain based crop insurance solution is suggested. The solution suggested in this paper is an affordable, efficient, low cost crop insurance solution which will ensure many farmers are insured and benefiting from timely crop insurance. Currently the cost of administering insurance is an essential barrier to accessing this fa-cility. With the proper use of blockchain based on ethereum this expense can be reduced dramati-cally. We have conducted various tests on platforms such as Google Cloud and found that the least throughput is 165 transactions. Upon analysis we have found that the time taken by the block for-mation is directly proportional to the timing of processing. The end-to-end average latency of the system was achieved as 31.2 s, which was quite effective for the infrastructure what we are using. Upon conducting acceptance testing, we found that the system suggested in the paper is effective and we are planning to release the application on open source platforms for future improvements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Crop insurance; Ethereum; Google Cloud; Latency; Open source","agricultural policy; efficiency measurement; farmers attitude; feasibility study; infrastructural development; insurance system; modernization; India","","","This research received Taif University Researchers Supporting Project number (TURSP-2020/115), Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.","Wikipedia the Free Encyclopedia; Farmers Suicides an Issue of Great Concern; Crop Insurance Schemes in India Need Importance and Benefits to Farmers; Performance and Scalability of Blockchain Networks and Smart Contracts, (2017); Asian Social Science, (2018); Nguyen, T.

The religiosity of an individual was assessed based on intra-religiosity and inter-religiosity parameters. The study examined the influence of religiosity on the attitude of respondents towards crowdfunding and giving donations in general, and further its impact on determining the intention of people towards donation-based crowdfunding campaigns. The data was collected from 304 respondents in India through an online questionnaire. The rationale behind choosing India was its diversity of religions. The data was collected through a snowball sampling approach and the questionnaire was shared within the personal and professional network. The structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was used to analyze the data. The study found that both Intrapersonal and Interpersonal religiosity dimensions have a positive influence on the attitude towards crowdfunding and donations in general. It also has a direct impact on the intention to participate in donation-based crowdfunding. Furthermore, a positive attitude towards donations will have a positive influence on this form of crowdfunding, however, no such significant relationship exists between attitude towards crowdfunding and intention. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attitude; Crowdfunding; Donation; Donation-based; India; Intention; Religion; Religiosity","","","","This research is funded by Woosong University Academic Research in 2021.","Abdel-Khalek, Ahmed M., The Relationship Between Religiosity and Anxiety: A Meta-analysis, Journal of Religion and Health, 58, 5, pp. 1847-1856, (2019); Empirical Economic Review, (2019); Megatrends 2010 the Rise of Conscious Capitalism, (2005); Agarwala, Ridhi, Religiosity and consumer behavior: a summarizing review, Journal of Management, Spirituality and Religion, 16, 1, pp. 32-54, (2019); Action Control from Cognition to Behavior, (1985); Analyzing Secularism Models the Case of Turkey, (2018); Alam, Syed Shah, Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in halal food purchasing, International Journal of Commerce and Management, 21, 1, pp. 8-20, (2011); International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, (2013); Alhazmi, Basem Masoud, Religiosity and customer trust in financial services marketing relationships, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 24, 1-2, pp. 31-43, (2019); Al-Hyari, Khalil Ahmad, Religious beliefs and consumer behaviour: From loyalty to boycotts, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 3, 2, pp. 155-174, (2012)","","International Association of Management Spirituality and Religion","","","","","","1942258X; 14766086","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117896378"

The first purpose is to examine the perception of Islamic finance experts and Shariah scholars on the Islamic cryptocurrency (i.e., GOLDX and OneGram). The question is whether it has a role in reconciling cryptocurrency in Islamic finance. The second is to introduce the new Islamic cryptocurrency to serve these rich Islamic populaces. The study used a qualitative research approach by conducting interviews to explore the Islamic scholars’ views on the framework of the new Islamic cryptocurrency. The scholars have been deemed to meet particular requirements of having comprehensive knowledge and have extensive experience in both the Islamic Shariah and cryptocurrency. Accordingly, the number of such scholars was limited, and eventually, with the access offered only to five scholars from different Islamic countries. We thoroughly analyzed the collected data from the interviews. The findings reveal that Islamic law is absent on the essential models for the conventional cryptocurrency utilization(such as bitcoin) as either a legitimate or illicit apparatus exchange device. Consequently, introducing new Islamic cryptocurrencies is to reconcile cryptocurrencies such as GOLDX and OneGram.

In addition, the authors classify the significant themes in this research stream, outline opportunities for future research directions and offer a future research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 221 scholarly articles published from 1997 to 2020 was investigated using the structured literature review method of Massaro et al. (2016). The authors used the bibliometrix R-package and VOSviewer software to mine information about journals, articles, authors, citations, keywords and countries. Findings: The analysis reveals five research clusters: halal food and the role of certifications, halal food and awareness, halal food production and quality, halal food in tourism management and halal food and the supply chain. The primary research flow comes from Asia. However, collaborations are also emerging in other continents. In addition, scholars should consider stressing the links among halal food and sustainability, innovation and technology. Research limitations/implications: The study analyses this field from a broad perspective, but only considers articles published in the Scopus database.

However, conventional and sharia fintech are two different systems and should have each regulation. The problem is if sharia fintech regulations in Indonesia is appropriate. Then what about Malaysia which are considered successful in developing the sharia fintech. This study compares sharia fintech regulations in Indonesia and Malaysia. The aim is to find out the readiness of Indonesia and Malaysia in supporting the sharia fintech trend realized in the regulations. This is a qualitative research using books and academic articles as an addition to the literature and regulations as the analytical method. The results indicate that Indonesia and Malaysia try to accommodate sharia fintech regulations. Indonesia still uses The Financial Services Authority Regulation (POJK) and Bank Indonesia regulations, both of which do not meet the sharia principles. Meanwhile, Malaysia uses the 2013 Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA), a law to regulate sharia compliance of the Islamic financial services sector, including the Sharia Fintech. In addition, Malaysia also has a Sharia Advisory Council as a supervisor for the Islamic financial services implementations. Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s regulations have yet answered the sharia fintech developments. Financial technology merupakan bagian dari ekosistem digital yang perkembangannya sangat pesat dan masif, tak terkecuali fintech syariah. Namun, fintech konvensional dan syariah adalah dua sistem yang berbeda dan seharusnya memiliki peraturan yang berbeda pula. Permasalahannya apakah regulasi fintech syariah di Indonesia sudah tepat apa belum, lalu bagaimana dengan regulasi di Malaysia yang dianggap berhasil mengembangkan fintech syariah. Tujuannya adalah untuk mengetahui sejauhmana kesiapan Indonesia dan Malaysia dalam mendukung trend fintech syariah dalam regulasi. Penelitian kualitatif ini menggunakan buku dan artikel akademis sebagai tambahan literatur dan peraturan sebagai metode analisis. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia dan Malaysia sama-sama berusaha mengakomodasi regulasi. Indonesia masih menggunakan Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan dan Peraturan Bank Indonesia, dan belum memenuhi prinsip syariah. Malaysia menggunakan Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA) 2013, sebuah Undang-Undang yang mengatur kepatuhan syariah dari sektor jasa keuangan Islam. Malaysia juga memiliki Dewan Pertimbangan Syariah sebagai pengawas pelaksanaan jasa keuangan Islam. Regulasi yang dimiliki oleh Malaysia dan Indonesia belum menjawab perkembangan fintech syariah. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial services authority regulations; islamic financial act; sharfintech","","","","","Razak, Muhammad Ilyas Ab, Fintech in Malaysia: An appraisal to the need of shariah-compliant regulation, Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 28, 4, pp. 3223-3233, (2021); Jurnal Legislatif, (2019); Al Qanun Jurnal Pemikiran Dan Pembaharuan Hukum Islam, (2018); Metode Penelitian Kualitatif, (2017); Edge Markets, (2016); Regulasi Dan Pengawasan Fintech Di Indonesia Persfektif Hukum Ekonomi Syariah, (2020); Iain Batusangkar, (2018); An Nisbah Jurnal Ekonomi Syariah, (2020); Teknologi Finansial Sistem Finansial Berbasis Teknologi Di Era Digital, (2020); Gomber, Peter, On the Fintech Revolution: Interpreting the Forces of Innovation, Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services, Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, 1, pp. 220-265, (2018)","","Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang","","","","","","20867549; 25283383","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182688754"

The purpose of this study was to examine the digital assets guarantee available in the Islamic banking system in the context of Islamic banking and Islamic Financial Technology (Fintech). It also highlights the role of Sharia banking in developing the Indonesian economy. A normative and comparative judicial approach was applied to achieve the study objectives. In addition, descriptive methods of analysis and prescriptive analysis were used to analyze the data. It was found that the Islamic banking system used information and communication technology for executing various financial transactions. Results also showed that no general laws and regulations were available regarding protecting Islamic financial digital property rights and guaranteeing Fintech as per the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Central Bank of Indonesia (BI). However, the Fatwa issued by the National Sharia Board of Indonesian Ulema (DSN MUI) presented necessary guidelines and legal protection for digital property and Fintech in Islamic banking.

Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. Blockchain technology can assist in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by assuring safe and reliable medical supplies, accurate identification of virus hot spots, and establishing data provenance to verify genuine personal protective equipment that is decentralized, reliable, traceable, and transparent. A major proportion of current healthcare systems are centralized and are short on privacy and information necessary for the detection of fraud connected to the certification by the COVID-19 vaccine. The quick vaccination rollout and the deployment of a global vaccination campaign are crucial and dependent on the availability of transparent and operational distribution chains, which may be audited by all the necessary parties. Blockchain technology might also be used to assure transparent monitoring, storage, and distribution of COVID19 vaccinations. Smart contracts are built for monitoring and tracking the proper circumstances of vaccine distribution in comparison to safe handling of vaccine producers, informing all network peers. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of block chain and smart contracts in the health care system. The article presents a model of the decentralized infrastructure of the health care system. The blockchain and intelligent contract technology provided has shown promising results.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a mono-method qualitative approach. Data were obtained from survey interviews of two issuances on the fusion of smart contracts in Ṣukūk structures that were Sharīʿah-compliant. A thematic approach was further used to analyze the interview data based on the onion research method while opportunities and challenges of activating the Smart Ṣukūk (SṢ) relied on doctrinal evidence. Findings: The results from the issuances across two jurisdictions showed that deployment of SṢ can resolve contractual ambiguities arising from Sharīʿah interpretations, jurisdictional policies and legal regime issues, which affect Ṣukūk origination and issuances especially on the right of investors in the event of Ṣukūk defaults. Although SṢ is automated, the third party’s presence is not eliminated as the blockchain platform still relies on the validators who are usually blockchain developers functioning as a third party in the Ṣukūk chain. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on doctrinal literature to explain the features and requirements of SṢ. The empirical approach is limited to interview data based on local SṢ issuances. Future studies need to explore regulators’ role and global standards in cross-border issuance of SṢ with multiple jurisdictions/laws. Practical implications: The paper concludes that the offering of SṢ using local currency has been successful in the two issuances because of the facilitative regulatory environment. However, addressing Ṣukūk’s challenges in cross-border offerings would require guidance from international standard-setters such as the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions and the Islamic Financial Services Board. Originality/value: This study is an advanced application of smart contracts to alleviate the related Ṣukūk challenges in the Islamic capital market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Sharīʿah-compliance; Smart Ṣukūk; Ṣukūk challenges","","","","","Malaysian Journal of Society and Space, (2016); Shariah Analysis of Bitcoin Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, (2018); Al Nahda, (2014); Badiu Al Aniu Tartb Shariu, (1986); Dirsat Fiqhiyah Iqtidiyah Ma Badilu Maqbla Sharan, (2018); Santander Settles both Sides of A 20 Million Bond Trade on Ethereum, (2019); Alswaidan, Mohammed Waleed, Understanding and evaluation of risk in Sukuk structures, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 8, 4, pp. 389-405, (2017); Al Hikmah Journal, (2019); Journal of Islamic Finance, (2019); Business Blockchain Promise Practice and Application of the Next Internet Technology, (2016)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17590825; 17590817","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114185464"

Internal variables comprise capital adequacy ratio (CAR), financing to deposit ratio (FDR), return on assets (ROA), operating expense ratio (OER), financing to value (FTV) and profit and loss sharing (PLS) financing ratio. External variables comprise inflation, economic growth and interest rate. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the annual reports of SRBs in Indonesia as secondary data for the years 2010–2019. Auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) is used as the analysis method to examine the short-run and long-run relationships between the variables. Findings: The findings indicate that four variables experienced a lag in the short run, namely, NPF, inflation, CAR and PLS, with different results recorded for each of the variables. Furthermore, the long-run results show that CAR and ROA influence the NPF of SRBs positively, whereas inflation and PLS have a negative influence on NPF. The rest of the variables – notably economic growth, interest rate, FDR, FTV and OER – do not have an influence on NPF in SRBs. Research limitations/implications: The level of NPF in SRBs exceeds the provision of the Central Bank of Indonesia. The findings are expected to have implications for SRBs and the regulator to consider and to manage the factors related to NPF properly due to the important role of SRBs in small and medium businesses’ development. Originality/value: This study measures the determinants of NPF using internal and external variables, including the addition of a dummy variable, notably FTV.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper discusses on blockchain benefits in Islamic finance while providing an illustration with smart Sukuk. Having identified the advantages of the development of Islamic financial technology (i-FinTech), this study ends by debating a couple of challenges (computational codification of Sharīʿah principles and environmental impact) that have to be addressed to promote the development of a real sustainable Islamic FinTech. Findings: This paper also identifies two challenges in using blockchain in i-Fintech. The first challenge refers to the extent to which Sharīʿah principles can be computationally encoded. Blockchain makes public all transactions that ease Sharīʿah compliance checks and determine if these transactions are Islamic in nature but this check can be done only after their operation. The second challenge is related to the algorithmic protocol used to validate smart contracts (including smart Sukuk).

However, the economic policy uncertainty is aggravated by problems, such as economic slump and trade friction. Thus, institutional investors are not optimistic about the prospects of innovation investment. To explore the influence of institutional investors on corporate innovation investment from the perspective of economic policy uncertainty, using the 2010-2018 panel data in China and the fixed effect model, the influences of institutional investors on innovation investment and the moderating effects of the economic policy uncertainty were analyzed. Results show that institutional investors facilitate corporate innovation investment. Moreover, the increasing economic policy uncertainties repress the promoting effect of institutional investors on innovation investment. Furthermore, the institutional investors boost the corporate innovation investment by improving the internal control and relieving the financing constraints. For private companies, new and high-tech companies, the promoting effect of institutional investors on the corporate innovation investment is inhibited by the economic policy uncertainty to a small extent. For the listed companies located in areas with a high level of investor protection and intellectual property protection, the economic policy uncertainty has a minimal influence on the institutional investors and corporate innovation investment. The conclusions obtained from this study provide empirical evidence for giving full play to the role played by institutional investors in corporate innovative development. The conclusions also reveal, from the macroscopic level, that the consistency and stability of governmental economic policies have important effects on corporate development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic policy uncertainty; Innovation investment; Institutional investor","","","","Acknowledgments: This study was supported by the Outstanding Youth Project of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China (20B326), the construct program of the applied characteristic discipline – Applied Economics in Hunan Province (2018469) and the General Project of Hunan Social Science Achievement Evaluation Committee (XSP21YBC193).","Aggarwal, Reena, Does governance travel around the world?

COVID-19 has caused economic disruption at an unprecedented speed and scale. The economic costs it will bring to society can only be measured in times to come. Millions of people across the globe have already become unemployed, and similarly, millions of businesses have either shut down or are on the verge of collapse. It is a great challenge for policymakers to minimize the economic impact of COVID-19 and put the economy on a growth trajectory once again. Unfortunately, there is so far no country in the world that can be viewed as a role model for its economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study proposes Islamic finance as a potential tool to help affected economies safely pass through the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic. This study identifies a four-stage COVID-19 model and proposes ten innovative Islamic financial services for each stage of the pandemic. In addition, it analyzes how these services can be effectively utilized at different stages to overcome the economic damage caused by the pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; Financial contagion; Fintech; Islamic finance","","","","","Weekly Operational Update on Covid 19, (2020); Lancet Infect Dis, (2021); Duszak, Richard L., Characteristics of COVID-19 Community Practice Declines in Noninvasive Diagnostic Imaging Professional Work, Journal of the American College of Radiology, 17, 11, pp. 1453-1459, (2020); Teerawattananon, Yot, COVID vaccination logistics: five steps to take now, Nature, 587, 7833, pp. 194-196, (2020); Grech, Victor E., Influenza vaccination in the COVID-19 era, Early Human Development, 148, (2020); Cozzi, Giorgio, The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy on a paediatric emergency setting, Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics, 109, 10, pp. 2157-2159, (2020); Mahajan, Ashutosh, An epidemic model SIPHERD and its application for prediction of the spread of COVID-19 infection in India, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 140, (2020); Atalan, Abdulkadir, Is the lockdown important to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic?

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study in which semi-structured interviews were carried out with several experts regarding the application of mudharabah in Islamic crowdfunding. To achieve the purpose of this study, the data is analysed based on thematic analysis. Findings: The findings reveal that even though Islamic crowdfunding could be an efficient platform through financial technology (Fintech), mudharabah is not an entirely ideal instrument, particularly for equity-based Islamic crowdfunding because of its high risk. These include fraudulent projects, insufficient regulations to protect investors’ money and the structure of mudharabah itself in which it is in the form of profit-sharing contract. However, the risk can be mitigated by using Fintech as a way to closely monitor the project, enhancing regulatory aspects to protect investment funds, enhancing mudharabah practice and creating awareness among all involving parties in terms of mudharabah philosophy. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited because it focuses on the current practice of Islamic crowdfunding in Malaysia, given that it is still a new industry. Currently, there is only one Islamic registered equity crowdfunding platform. Also, as the number of interviewees in this study is limited because of purposive sampling, the findings may be considered the result of an exploratory study. Practical implications: An equity Islamic crowdfunding platform based on mudharabah can be proposed, particularly to support micro enterprises in which they involve small capital. Also, this model can be considered for less risky ventures such as investment in food industries or technology sectors. Social implications: Mudharabah Islamic crowdfunding model could potentially support local businesses, especially for start-ups. By channelling money among society, it is not only creating a wealth circulation among society, which is one of the Sharīʿah objectives in finance, but it also promotes mutual cooperation and kindness among society members. Originality/value: While Islamic crowdfunding is not a new topic in research, it lacks empirical studies, particularly qualitative analysis. As this study engages with experts in Sharīʿah and crowdfunding regarding the potential application of mudharabah, it highlights a fresh discussion both in theory and practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic crowdfunding; Islamic finance; Mudharabah","","","","This research is fully funded by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme for Research Acculturation of Early Career Researchers (FRGS-RACER) entitled \u201CDeveloping \u2018FundMyBook\u2019 Model Based on Mudharabah Crowdfunding Platform as a Capital Source for Books Publication\u201D(RACER/1/2019/SS01/UNISZA//3).","Islam and Civilisational Renewal, (2016); Abdullah, Syahida, Towards a sharī’ah compliant equity-based crowdfunding for the halal industry in Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Society, 18, S1, pp. 223-240, (2017); European Journal of Islamic Finance, (2016); Al Fiqh Al Islami Wa Adillatuh, (1997); Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce, (2019); Shariah Standard on Mudharabah, (2012); Licensing Framework for Digital Banks Exposure Draft, (2019); Conway, James M., A Meta-Analysis of Interrater and Internal Consistency Reliability of Selection Interviews, Journal of Applied Psychology, 80, 5, pp. 565-579, (1995); Educational Research Planning Conducting and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research, (2002); Diaw, Abdou, A comparative study of the returns on Mudhārabah deposit and on equity in Islamic banks, Humanomics, 27, 4, pp. 229-242, (2011)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17554179; 17554187","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101439007"

This study highlights the influential and conceptual aspects of blockchain and cryptocurrency literature with bibliometric analysis. There are 1965 related documents from 2015 and 2020, represent various structures and technologies, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain applications. We have deployed 'bibliometrix 3.0', the r-package, and VOS viewer to analyze key literature aspects. IEEE Access is the core journal for cryptocurrency and blockchain publications. The University of Cagliari, Notreported, and Peking University are key affiliations, and the USA, China, and India are core countries for literary research. H. Wang is the core author with the central theme of security of blockchain technologies. It is a set basis for conceptual aspects, core, and future research streams and themes. The study proposes three research streams: the structure of cryptocurrencies and implications of blockchain technologies, privacy, security management of data and information, and development of optimal information systems. The study further segregates themes into highly centralized and motor themes that are also core themes.

It identifies the emerging themes in the financial inclusion literature as well as some controversy in policy circles regarding financial inclusion. In particular, I draw attention to some issues such as optimal financial inclusion, extreme financial inclusion, how financial inclusion can transmit systemic risks to the formal financial sector, and whether financial inclusion and exclusion are pro-cyclical with changes in the economic cycle. The key findings in this review indicate that financial inclusion affects, and is influenced by, the level of financial innovation, poverty-levels, the stability of the financial sector, the state of the economy, financial literacy, and regulatory frameworks which differ across countries. Finally, the issues discussed in this paper opens up several avenues for future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","controversy; digital finance; economic cycle; financial inclusion; financial institutions; financial stability; financial technology; Fintech; poverty reduction; systemic risk","","","","Another concern is the paucity of critical studies in the financial inclusion literature. By critical studies, I mean studies that challenge the proxies used, and the assumptions underlying current financial inclusion models. There are few critical studies on financial inclusion, for example, Mader (). The few number of critical studies in the financial inclusion literature is attributed to the fact that policy makers, development economists and practitioners want research that produce results and solutions that are pro-poor and pro-financial inclusion, and they are not interested in critical research. This led to increased demand for positivist research on financial inclusion through increased research funding and attractive research grants for financial inclusion research, and subsequently led to low demand for critical research in financial inclusion.","Adomako, Samuel, The moderating influence of financial literacy on the relationship between access to finance and firm growth in Ghana, Venture Capital, 18, 1, pp. 43-61, (2016); Journal of Finance, (2013); Microfinance in the Arab World the Challenge of Financial Inclusion, (2010); Allen, Franklin, The African financial development and financial inclusion gaps, Journal of African Economies, 23, 5, pp. 614-642, (2014); Allen, Franklin, The foundations of financial inclusion: Understanding ownership and use of formal accounts, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 27, pp. 1-30, (2016); International Journal of Asian Social Science, (2019); Financial Technology and Disruptive Innovation in Asean, (2020); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2015)","","Routledge","","","","","","18746381; 07360932","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078471678"

Design/methodology/approach: After documenting historical developments in currency systems, the study reviews the Islamic perspective on the matter. Features of an ideal currency system are listed and then a critical evaluation of existing currency systems – fiat, banking and cryptocurrency – is undertaken. Findings: It is found that existing currency systems – fiat, banking and cryptocurrency – are not compatible with the socio-economic objectives of a forward-looking, progressive society, which upholds transparency and justice as its core values. The study documents that Sharīʿah norms have no preference or dislike for any of the existing currency systems. Any prudent currency system compatible with the objectives of the Islamic financial system (i.e. stability and equitable distribution of wealth) is acceptable. A single international reserve currency (with country-specific legal tendering) is subject to the risk of destabilisation across global markets. Practical implications: This paper recommends autonomy of central banking, the spending of seigniorage for the welfare of community members, development of asset-backed currencies (following ṣukūk structures), as well as multiple international reserve currencies and joining of hands by professionals and Sharīʿah scholars to design a currency system compatible with the Islamic financial system. This paper’s recommendation is against the adoption of cryptocurrency that lacks the backing of real assets. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by evaluating the compatibility of existing currency systems in the achievement of socio-economic objectives of a welfare state which seeks to uphold justice and equitable resource distribution as core values in the financial system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Fiat currency; International currency; Islamic currency","","","","","Abdullah, Adam, An Islamic monetary theory of value and equation of exchange: evidence from Egypt (696-1517), Humanomics, 32, 2, pp. 121-150, (2016); Corr, (2016); Seisense Journal of Management, (2018); International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration, (2017); Journal of Islamic Economics Banking and Finance, (2016); Ajouz, Mousa, Developing a Sharīʿah-Compliant Precious Metal Backed Cryptocurrency, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 33, 1, pp. 3-20, (2020); Frequently Asked Questions, (2018); Innovation and Authenticity in Islamic Finance, (2008); Islam and the Economic Challenge, (1992); Islamic Economic Studies, (1996)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","22894365; 01281976","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097814181"

Blockchain works over the principle of distributed, secured, and shared ledger, which is used to record, and track data within a decentralized network. This technology has successfully replaced certain systems of economic transactions in organizations and has the potential to overtake various industrial business models in future. Blockchain works over peer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any trusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The information stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized network and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the beginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is increasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions regarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy of blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential privacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In this article, we cover the topic of integration of differential privacy in each layer of blockchain and in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we highlight some future challenges and application scenarios in which integration of differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Differential privacy; Privacy preservation","Data privacy; Digital storage; Hash functions; Application scenario; Cryptographic hash functions; Decentralized networks; Differential privacies; Economic transactions; Future challenges; Privacy and security; Trusted third parties; Blockchain","","","This paper is partly supported by Australian Research Council (ARC) projects DP190101893 , DP170100136 , LP140100816 , and LP180100758 .","Abawajy, Jemal H., Privacy preserving social network data publication, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 18, 3, pp. 1974-1997, (2016); Ali, Muneeb, Blockstack: A global naming and storage system secured by blockchains, pp. 181-194, (2016); Ali, Muhammad Salek, Applications of Blockchains in the Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 2, pp. 1676-1717, (2019); Alidin, Az Azrinudin, Overview of Blockchain Implementation on Islamic Finance: Saadiqin Experience, (2018); Alnemari, Asma, Protecting infrastructure data via enhanced access control, blockchain and differential privacy, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 542, pp. 113-125, (2018); Androulaki, Elli, Hyperledger Fabric: A Distributed Operating System for Permissioned Blockchains, 2018-January, (2018); Apple Machine Learning Journal, (2017); Moises Arantes, Gladstone, Improving the Process of Lending, Monitoring and Evaluating Through Blockchain Technologies: An Application of Blockchain in the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), pp. 1181-1188, (2018); Uci Machine Learning Repository, (2007); Avantaggiato, Mirko, Challenges and opportunities using multichain for real estate, (2019)","","Academic Press Inc. apjcs@harcourt.com","","","","","","07437315","","JPDCE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087330875"

Design/methodology/approach: A sample that consists of 143 Malaysian Halal food and beverage manufacturers was drawn from Halal Malaysia Official Portal using the simple random sampling technique. The responses were collected from the key managerial personnel with experience and knowledge on the Halal supply chain using phone interviews. Subsequently, the partial least squares structural equation modelling approach was then used to analyse the theoretical model. Findings: The manufacturers would go through a chain of the process before deciding to participate in the traceability system. Firstly, the manufacturers which practice a comprehensive Halal orientation strategy will be more perceptive towards the institutional pressures that demand them to participate in a traceability system. Secondly, in response to the pressures, the manufacturers would evaluate the technological characteristics of the system and subsequently develop their perceived desirability. Thirdly, the manufacturers with favourable perceived desirability shall decide to participate in the system.

On the same note, the literature on determinants of Islamic FinTech acceptance and TAM was reviewed as well in a bid to contribute to the factors that are instrumental in determining the acceptance of FinTech services. Findings: Findings of the study reveal that Islamic FinTech’s services acceptance is determined by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and also by another variable, which is consumer innovativeness (CI). On the contrary other factors, self-efficacy and subjective norms are found not to be influential in determining Islamic FinTech’s acceptance by Islamic banking users.

Bitcoin is has been used as a case study which is one of the type of cryptocurrency. There are huge discrepancies from many Islamic school of thought about transaction with bitcoin. Specifically, some school of thought viewed it as a tool used for illegal purposes and that the global public already uses Bitcoin mostly for illegal and non-Shari'ah-compliant purposes under Islamic perceptions. As a result, this study developed an interview-qualitative research approach in order to examine how the negative perceptions of cryptocurrency from Islamic views cnd be purify. Sample of Eight informant were used in the study. The finding of this study indicated that the use of cryptocurrency as a legitimate as any payment method. It is also argued that it facilitated transactions and cut the normal cost of international money transfer, and some Muslim countries are actively encouraging the use of cryptocurrency due to its easy use and transparency. This has been also supported by “hadith”. Finally, the analysis also confirmed that from the Shari'ah point of view, cryptocurrencies are as compliant as fiat money and ought to be accepted as another mode of payment that can be used in transaction as its value can be measured and quantified.

Introducing precious metal-backed cryptocurrencies is perceived to be an innovation among global payment systems, hampered in part by lack of supporting empirical evidence. Therefore, this research investigates potential users' tendency to adopt a Sharīʿah-compliant precious metal-backed cryptocurrency. As such, this study adopts an extended adoption model, which consists of eight factors. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was conducted on data elicited from economic active residents in Klang Valley from questionnaires.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative methodology is used in conducting this research where relevant literature on ṣukūk was reviewed. Through a doctrinal approach, the paper presents analyses on the practice of ṣukūk and ṣukūk on blockchain by discussing its legal, Sharīʾah and regulatory issues. This culminates in a conceptual analysis of blockchain ṣukūk and its peculiar challenges. Findings: This paper reveals that digitizing ṣukūk issuance through blockchain remedies certain inefficiencies associated with ṣukūk transactions. Indeed, structuring ṣukūk on a blockchain platform can increase transparency of underlying ṣukūk assets and cash flows in addition to reducing costs and the number of intermediaries in ṣukūk transactions. The paper likewise brings to light legal, regulatory, Sharīʾah and cyber risks associated with ṣukūk on blockchain that confront investors, practitioners and regulators. This calls for deeper collaboration in research among Sharīʾah scholars, lawyers, regulators and information technology experts. Research limitations/implications: As a pioneering subject, the paper notes the prospects of blockchain ṣukūk and the current dearth of literature on it. The paper would assist relevant Islamic capital market entities and authorities to determine the potential and impact of blockchain ṣukūk in their respective businesses and the financial system. Practical implications: Blockchain ṣukūk will assist in addressing issues inherent in classical ṣukūk and in paving the way to innovative solutions that will facilitate and enhance the quality of ṣukūk transactions. For that, ṣukūk would require appropriate regulatory technology to address its governance and regulation peculiarities. Originality/value: Integrating ṣukūk with blockchain technology will add value to it.

The implication of such a system is the emergence of many socio-economic problems. Restoring the value of money has long been a controversial topic, hampered in part by the lack of theoretical and empirical evidences. Therefore, this research aims to develop a Sharīʿah-compliant precious metal backed crypto-currency (PMBC) mechanism. To achieve this, a general product development process is adopted, which consists of four phases involving planning, concept development, system-level design, and testing. In addition, Sharīʿah scholars and financial experts were interviewed to validate the mechanism theoretically. The result of this research was to introduce a Sharīʿah-compliant PMBC where the description and the modus operandi of the PMBC were presented. This research defined PMBC as a digital currency, backed by precious metals that uses strong cryptography.

Riba or interest arises when foreign currencies are bought and sold at different rates. From the Islamic perspective, the difference between the buying and selling rates of foreign exchange will constitute Riba. Also, this paper examines the effects of eliminating such Riba on major macroeconomic variables. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the hadith which imply that if buying and selling rates of currencies or foreign exchanges are same, i.e. if one sells BD1 = Dh10 and Dh10 = BD1 on spot, there will be no Riba. This can be guaranteed if the Islamic banking system introduces the technology, often known as FinTech interest-free foreign exchange bank machines (IFfexBM), which will automatically dispense BD10 for Dh100 and vice-versa, both locally and globally, and it will have tremendous positive effects in the economy. Furthermore, the effects of introducing FinTech for eliminating Riba will be analyzed on economic and international trade activities by using aggregate expenditure (AE) and aggregate output model within the tenets of Islamic principles. Findings: If Islamic banks (IBs) can introduce FinTech global network system where any client can buy or sell foreign currency at the same rate without any markup, it will increase the market share for IBs by increasing the number of customers and number of branches, and it will increase the inflow of funds and volumes of transactions, especially in international trade, global financial transactions and cross-border shopping. Such an increase in transactions will increase AE and AE will continuously shift up. Such an upward shift will have positive effects on equilibrium output, employment and prosperity. Originality/value: This is, perhaps, one of the latest attempts to eliminate Riba from foreign exchange transactions by introducing FinTech IFfexBM in each and every locality. Such elimination of Riba will not only reduce the cost of cross-border transactions but it will also reduce cost in international trade and financial transactions among nations, and therefore, it will have expansionary effects on equilibrium output, employment and global prosperity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FinTech; Foreign currency transactions; Full employment; Interest-free foreign exchange bank machines; International trade and financial transactions; Riba","","","","","Abozaid, Abdulazeem Jalal, Does shariah recognize cryptocurrencies as valid currencies?, pp. 174-191, (2019); Agheli, Lotfali, Impact of information and communication technology on transport among the selected Middle East countries, Journal of Economic Cooperation and Development, 39, 1, pp. 1-18, (2018); Al Iqtishad Journal of Islamic Economics, (2018); Ajouz, Mousa, Acceptance of Sharīʿah-compliant precious metal-backed cryptocurrency as an alternative currency: An empirical validation of adoption of innovation theory, Thunderbird International Business Review, 62, 2, pp. 171-181, (2020); Fintech and Islamic Finance, (2019); Fintech in Islamic Finance Theory and Practice, (2019); Journal of King Abdulaziz University Islamic Economics, (2006); Barata, Amrin, STRENGTHENING NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EQUITABLE INCOME THROUGH SHARIA DIGITAL ECONOMY IN INDONESIA, Journal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance, 5, 1, pp. 145-168, (2019); Islamic Social Finance, (2018); Fintech in Islamic Finance, (2019)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17538394; 17538408","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097621542"

Many people perform transactions related to vehicles in their daily life; transportation authorities also perform vehicle transactions as part of managing vehicle fleets. But tracking these transactions is a challenging task. There are countrywide solutions that uses centralized systems. However, these solutions have problems with trust management, transparency, and access control. Therefore, we believe there is still room for integrated automation of various vehicle-related transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based framework for vehicle tracking that incorporates the mentioned features. Moreover, blockchain is customized to enable usage control for additional transactions, such as inspection, renting and islamic insurance. The usage control model is integrated with IoT devices to continuously monitor the vehicles for certain conditions and remotely revoke access if needed. The complete transaction set is recorded over an immutable ledger that provides trust, transparency and a complete history of record. In this paper, we also presents a prototype implementation of a permissioned blockchain, which will be made available under the GNUv3 General Public License. Performance analysis is performed on the newly proposed framework implementation over the permissioned blockchain to measure its adoption and suitability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; decentralized applications; smart contracts; vehicle life cycle tracking","Access control; Blockchain; Life cycle; Open source software; Transparency; Vehicles; Centralized systems; End-to-end solutions; General Public License; Integrated automation; Performance analysis; Prototype implementations; Regular inspections; Traffic violation; Accidents","","","This work was supported by the Deanship of Research at Islamic University of Madinah through the Tamayyuz project titled: Blockchain Based Secure and Efficient Life-Cycle Tracking and Management of Vehicles: A Prototype Implementation for KSA under Grant 25/tm/40.","Ali, Jawad, Blockchain-based smart-IoT trust zone measurement architecture, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Part F148162, pp. 152-157, (2019); Cong, Lin William, Blockchain Disruption and Smart Contracts, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1754-1797, (2019); Biais, Bruno, The Blockchain Folk Theorem, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1662-1715, (2019); Abdeen, Mohammad A.R., Employing Takaful islamic banking through state of the art blockchain: A case study, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 10, 12, pp. 648-654, (2019); Syed, Toqeer Ali, A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Architecture and its Applications: Problems and Recommendations, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 176838-176869, (2019); Böhme, Rainer, Bitcoin: Economics, technology, and governance, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29, 2, pp. 213-238, (2015); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Ethereum A Secure Decentralised Generalised Transaction Ledger, (2014); Alkhodre, Ahmad Badreddin, A Blockchain-based value added tax (VAT) system: Saudi Arabia as a use-case, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 10, 5, pp. 708-716, (2019); Bauer, Ingrid, Exploring blockchain value creation: The case of the car ecosystem, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2019-January, pp. 6865-6874, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087280432"

Similarly, the sharia financial technology industry also grows rapidly due to Muslim adoption of information technology for financial transaction. However, limited studies have been conducted to understand the factors that influence Muslim consumers to adopt sharia FinTech products. Through the use of the variables of halal product expectation, social environment, and fiqih knowledge, we surveyed eighty Muslim sharia FinTech consumers to understand whether those three variables affect their intention to use sharia FinTech products such as online loans. The results show that halal product expectation and fiqih knowledge factors have significantly affect Muslim consumers in Indonesia to use sharia FinTech products. Meanwhile, social environment, such as friends or higher Muslim figures, does not influence Muslim consumers to use the sharia FinTech products. We conclude that sharia FinTech companies should focus on improving their products to comply with Islamic sharia principles rather than using social environment to attract Muslim consumers to purchase their products. Future research may require more variable in similar studies to increase validity and reliability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fiqih knowledge; Sharia financial technology; Sharia FinTech product expectation; Social environment","","","","","International Journal of Social Science Studies, (2016); Al-Hajla, Ali Homaid, Understanding New Religion-Compliant Product Adoption (NRCPA) in Islamic Markets, Journal of Global Marketing, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2019); Ada 150 Juta Pengguna Internet Ojk Dorong Peran Fintech, (2019); Mengenal Fintech Syariah Apa Perbedaannya Dengan Konvensional, (2018); Paper Presented at the International Conference on Economics, (2019); International Journal of Exercise Science, (2015); Mau Ajukan Dana Pinjaman Pastikan Dulu Penyedianya Ada Di Daftar Ojk Berikut Ini, (2019); Briliana, Vita, Exploring antecedents and consequences of Indonesian Muslim youths’ attitude towards halal cosmetic products: A case study in Jakarta, Asia Pacific Management Review, 22, 4, pp. 176-184, (2017); Bukhari, Syed Faheem Hasan, Is religiosity an important consideration in Muslim consumer behavior: Exploratory study in the context of western imported food in Pakistan, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 10, 4, pp. 1288-1307, (2019); Chen, Zhuming, The transition from traditional banking to mobile internet finance: an organizational innovation perspective - a comparative study of Citibank and ICBC, Financial Innovation, 3, 1, (2017)","","Primrose Hall Publishing Group","","","","","","22011323; 22011315","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085189312"

The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of Islamic Fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other FinTech users.

In addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of Fintech; and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities. Websites on the financial departments of universities in the GCC, data from the national education Ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.The findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the GCC is included in the top 10 leaders in Fintech/crypto education. Despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the GCC have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the Fintech sector. Furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field. Approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology.

We apply a ML approach for topic detection to analyze emerging topics in the literature—our context is accounting and finance research in the Asia–Pacific region. To evaluate the robustness of the approach, we compare findings from the automated ML approach with the results from a manual analysis of the literature. The automated approach uses a keyword algorithm detection mechanism whereby the manual analysis uses common techniques for qualitative data analysis, that is, triangulation between researchers (expert judgement). From our paper, we conclude that both methods have strengths and weaknesses. The automated analysis works well for large corpora of text and provides a very standardized and non-biased way of analyzing the literature. However, the human researcher is potentially better equipped to evaluate current issues and future trends in the literature. Overall, the best results might be achieved when a variety of tools are used together. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting research; Asia–Pacific; Entity linking; Environmental finance; Finance research; Research agenda; Research trends; Review","","","","Initial topic list Identification of ‘emerging Topics’ Final iteration Accounting Education Accounting Information Systems Accounting Standards Anomalies and Empirical Regularities Asset Pricing Auditing Behavioural Finance Bitcoin CEO Compensation China Conditional Asset Pricing Conservatism Corporate Finance Corporate Governance Cost of Capital Cryptocurrency Disclosure Diversity Earnings Management Electronic Markets Emerging Markets Environmental Accounting Environmental Finance Factor Models Financial Analysis Financial Crises Financial Reporting FinTech Future Research in Auditing Future Research in International Accounting Standards Global Environmental Change (incl.

I empirically describe how colonial-contingent, neoliberal economic policies in Puerto Rico have incentivized the techno-capitalist industries of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Portions of the archipelago are being re-made into a so-called “crypto-utopia” to satisfy the desires of new settlers in a new form of crypto-colonialism. Puerto Rican government organizations, institutions, and businesses are also engaging blockchain technology with differing intents, all using rhetoric as a covert design tool. In this paper I will focus on blockchain and cryptocurrency as neoliberal and libertarian technologies adopted by governmental agencies, businesses, organizations, and individuals, as well as efforts of resistance through alternative, decolonial design. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cryptoeconomics; decolonial design; punitive neoliberalism; Settler colonialism; technopolitics","","","","For the writing of this paper, I owe much to Andrew Mercado-Vázquez and Noemí Segarra for their connections, passion, and discussions.

The idea of cryptocurrency was introduced to handle the mistrust of financial intermediaries that led to the liquidity crisis. This study investigates whether the new cryptocurrencies have been able to perform the functions of financial intermediaries and offer the confidence level required by bank depositors, examining their long-run effect on banks' deposit mobilization. The study applies a cointegration test analysis with a vector error correction model to examine this relationship. Overall results indicate that in the countries studied increases in the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry have a significant negative impact on banks' deposit variability, while decreases have a positive impact, with a long-run equilibrium relationship. The outcomes of the study suggest that in order to regain the trust of depositors and avoid the effects of the cryptocurrency industry, banks should be encouraged to invest directly in cryptocurrency or should consider cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment asset for their portfolio investment diversification strategies during bullish market conditions and avoid them during bearish market conditions. Also, banks can incorporate blockchain technology into their operation system and compete with the cryptocurrency industry side by side in the financial market. If neither of these options is taken, however, the banking system may not be able to compete and sustain in the long term using the current operational model. The outcomes of this study can be used as policy guidance by central banks and the banking industry for the betterment of the industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Akaike, Hirotsugu, A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, 6, pp. 716-723, (1974); Impact of the Monetary Policy Instruments on Islamic Stock Market Index Return, (2011); International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration, (2017); Introductory Econometrics for Finance, (2002); Dickey, David A., Distribution of the Estimators for Autoregressive Time Series With a Unit Root, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74, 366, pp. 427-431, (1979); Applied Econometric Time Series, (1995); Microeconomics of Banking, (1997); Gatteschi, Valentina, Blockchain and smart contracts for insurance: Is the technology mature enough?, Future Internet, 10, 2, (2018); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1979); Initial Coin Offerings Financing Growth with Cryptocurrency Token Sales, (2018)","","Portfolio Management Research info@iijournals.com","","","","","","15347524","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088541308"

Blockchain, on the hand, is decentralizing the system of records and control which makes crowdfunding more transparent and secure. Though a number of blockchain-based crowdfunding platforms are already doing good business and they vary in crypto, model and type of crowdfunding. The study is conducted on a very new blockchain-based crowdfunding platform, WHIRL. The unique and different in this model is the model, “pay-it-forward” itself.

It focuses on the great promise of transparency in blockchain systems, its tamper-proof nature and the question of ‘Who will be the data controller in blockchain transactions?’ In blockchain systems, data is distributed across all the nodes’ (who created the blocks) computers at different locations. This makes it difficult to amend the data in the blocks as all the nodes’ participation and approval are needed. While this feature provides transparency and resilience, it is a major challenge on exercising the rights of rectification or deletion. Blockchain systems can be created as private and public, and particularly in public blockchain systems, it can be challenging to allocate and determine the liability of the parties and determine the data controller. We look into the challenges in these areas in a nutshell and very briefly mention how blockchain can benefit from the privacy by design concept. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blockchain; compliance; individual rights; privacy; tamper-proof","","","","","Beyond Bitcoin Legal Impurities and Off Chain Assets, (2017); Research Report 2, (2018); Kuner, Christopher B., Blockchain versus data protection, International Data Privacy Law, 8, 2, pp. 103-104, (2018); Iapp, (2018); undefined; Finck, Michele, Blockchain Regulation and Governance in Europe, pp. 1-214, (2018); IBM Institute for Business Value Survey Conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, (2018); Blockchain and the Law the Rule of Code, (2018); Finck; Finck","","Henry Stewart Publications","","","","","","23981687; 23981679","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128745166"

To address this question, we examine a set of technologies that have received increasing industry, media, and scholarly attention over the past decade: blockchains. Harnessing the concepts of ‘moral economy’ and ‘scandal’, we identify both possibilities and limits for blockchain applications to legitimate a range of monetary and investment activities. However, we also find that a persistent individualisation of responsibility for failures and shortcomings with ‘live’ blockchain experimentation has undermined the potentially legitimating aspects of this technology. Combining a reliance on technological fixes with a persistent individualist moral economy, we conclude, works against efforts to confront head-on the tensions underpinning the on-going legitimacy crises facing finance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; cryptocurrency; digital money; legitimacy; scandal; technology","","","","We are grateful for feedback received from the two journal reviewers and editors, as well as participants in the the 2018 Finance and Society Network Conference in Edinburgh and the 2018 European Workshop in International Studies on 'Wrongdoing, International Scandal, and the Politics of Responsibility'.

The conventional insurance work on the principle of bilateral contracts between the customer (insured) and insurance provider where the insured pay regular premium in return for payment of compensation, in case of a predefined event occurs. On the other hand, Takaful works on the principle of mutual guarantee, cooperation and indemnity where the participants in the scheme mutually insure each other.

Initially, few structures were developed to help cater to the attention of the Islamic financial industry players involved in peer-to-peer dealings. The new trend of the technological evolution in the banking and financial sector has proved to be the next challenge in this sector. However, the survival of Islamic fintech will heavily rely on the existing established trust within the sector. The potential collaborations between the established Islamic banks, fintech players and start-ups will certainly unleash the potentials of today’s technologies in the Islamic finance industry. Being in their early stages, Malaysia and its counterparts from the GCC states have the potentials to becoming leaders in the Islamic fintech industry and may work together to develop a necessary framework for Islamic fintech advancement. Peer-to-peer arrangement connects crowdfunding investors with entrepreneurs through more transparency, speed dealings and almost free from complications in the documentation. In view of the fact that mushārakah is becoming more practical under the concept of Islamic peer-to-peer deals, this paper attempts to develop a new peer-to-peer financing which is underlain by the Mushārakah Smart Contract Model. The paper proposes a mushārakah model using Mushārakah Smart Contract in which the investors would be crediting their investments for mushārakah purposes with virtual lenders for specific Sharīʽah compliant businesses and share in the profit, based on an agreed dividend under the mushārakah principles.

The smart contract has an increasing role in governing the legal relationship between the interested parties. This research explores the current position of smart contracts in Malaysia and the viability of the Malaysian framework in handling the latest development. This research adopts the qualitative and doctrinal legal approaches in analysing the current legal practice, the relevant statutes and the viability of the Malaysian legal framework. These approaches are necessary to be carried out in ensuring the workability of smart contracts in Blockchain. Additionally, the practices of smart contracts from international experiences are collected as case studies in this research. As a part of the findings, the researchers found that smart contracts are more or less similar to traditional contracts. Therefore, the requirements as stipulated under the Contract Act 1950 that are applicable in Malaysia must be followed accordingly. In this study, based on the nature of Blockchain technology, the researchers evaluate the current position of Malaysian laws in dealing with smart contracts. Additionally, the researchers also looked at the acceptable legal practice of smart contracts in Malaysia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Contract Act 1950; Fintech; Malaysia; Smart contract","","","","","Allens Releases A Landmark Report on Blockchain, (2016); Smart Contracts in Australia Just how Smart They are, (2017); Malaysian Business Magazine, (2018); Transactions in Malaysia to Be Almost Cashless by 2025, (2018); Meaning of Decentralization, (2017); Assembly Bill 2658, (2019); California S Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; Statement on Bitcoin, (2014); Digital Currencies, (2016); Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox Framework, (2018)","","International Islamic University Malaysia intdiscourse@iium.edu.my","","","","","","22895639; 01284878","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077909329"

This study uses a combination of primary and secondary sources to assess the current state of the notary responsibility situation regarding banks and the financial lending world in general and employs a normative or doctrinal approach that views laws as a system of norms. The functions of notaries in Indonesia are different from those performed by notaries in some other countries, the notaries play different roles and participate in many formalities: a) a function in credit banking bind guarantees that not only allow people to feel comfortable with their transactions, but also increase public trust in the whole banking system; b) personal and material guarantees. In transacting any deeds, including credit bank guarantees, the notary is responsible for the authenticity of the physical, formal and material aspects of the deed; c) the binding of collateral objects; d) a function in binding banking credit guarantees. Also, notaries have the risk of illegal jurisdiction of a banking credit guarantee deed.

It is argued that through proper regulation, such innovative dispute management mechanism would not only address some legal risks associated with banking disputes but could also prevent reputational risks in the Islamic financial services industry. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an internet survey, responses were obtained from about 109 respondents in Malaysia. The data obtained were subjected to multivariate statistical analyses considering factors such as access to justice, attitude of stakeholders, resolving disputes, practical issues and understanding of ODR. Findings: The results obtained showed that “access to justice”, “attitude of stakeholders” and “resolving disputes” are the most influencing factors affecting the intention to use ODR among stakeholders, particularly customers and bankers in the Islamic financial services industry in Malaysia. Practical implications: This study provides a way in which the recently introduced Islamic Financial Services (Financial Ombudsman Scheme) Regulations 2015 can be better enhanced to cater for internet banking disputes which might require an ODR framework. Originality/value: Though there have been numerous studies on the dispute resolution framework in the Islamic banking industry in Malaysia generally, the current study focuses on a less explored framework – ODR– a new framework for handling banking disputes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative dispute resolution; Dispute resolution; Islamic banking; Islamic finance; Malaysia; Online dispute resolution","","","","","International Arbitration with Commentary to Malaysian Arbitration Act 2005, (2016); University of Miami Inter American Law Review, (2013); Hamline Journal of Public Law and Policy, (2005); Investment Advisor Magazine, (2014); Baida, Ziv, A shared service terminology for online service provisioning, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 60, pp. 1-10, (2004); Barth, James R., Bank regulation and supervision: What works best?, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 13, 2, pp. 205-248, (2004); International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in Uncitral Model Law Jurisdictions, (2010); Fundamental Principles of Financial Regulation, (2009); Cortés, Pablo, Developing online dispute resolution for consumers in the EU: A proposal for the regulation of accredited providers, International Journal of Law and Information Technology, 19, 1, pp. 1-28, (2011); Online Dispute Resolution, (2012)","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.
